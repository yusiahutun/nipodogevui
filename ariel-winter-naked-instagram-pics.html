For instance, the actress&nbsp;shared a photo of a graduation party dress that pretty explicitly&nbsp;exposed her breasts—a choice she made on her own—and it drew thousands of comments, including ones that applauded the teen (“you look amazing in that dress!”) and others that were a little—nay, a lot—less effusive. A day later, Winter to social media to clap back at her critics.</p><p>“Dear sorry body-shamers, I looked HOT in that dress,” she&nbsp;tweeted. “And if you hate it, don’t buy it. But please get a hobby. XOXO Ariel #EmbraceYourBody.”</p><p>Like the Kim Kardashians of the world before her, Winter clearly turned what many perceive&nbsp;as a negative into a women’s lib&nbsp;battle cry of sorts, prompting the question of whether women who choose to freely show their bodies in whatever way they want are redefining <a href=# id=auto-tag_feminism data-tag=feminism>feminism</a> for a modern age or, well, not.</p><p>It’s a conversation we need to have, given the prevalence of—to put it plainly—very naked women at every turn on social media. Society’s instinct is to implore women to cover up, but it’s hard to tell&nbsp;a female who’s&nbsp;proud of&nbsp;her body (especially when it’s not unrealistically emaciated) to stop being that way.</p><p>But either way, Winter DGAF what haters say, and she’s going to keep doing her thing.</p><p>Updated 8/11/2017.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2idnqmys8DAoqWmnZ6pfHd8kGlsbGeRp7amuIywoKeslad6r63KnptmoZ6owaKz0ZqkZqiZmMBw</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./12-famous-brides-who-had-a-very-non-traditional-wedding-gown.html><span>←</span><span>12 Famous Brides Who Had A Very Non-Traditional Wedding Gown</span></a>
