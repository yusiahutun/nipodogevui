The singer managed to leave a mark on the industry very early in his career. Since then, he has evolved into an actor and a producer. Despite juggling different roles, his legacy in the music industry continues to grow.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2023/09/GettyImages-1454498386-683x1024.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-what-happened-when-50-cent-was-8-years-old>What happened when 50 Cent was 8 years old?</h2><p>When 50 Cent was 8 years old he lost his mother, Sabrina Jackson. Sabrina was only 15 years old when she gave birth to the singer. She continued being a single mother as 50 Cent’s father wasn’t present in their life.</p><p>Sadly, she passed away in a fire accident when she was 28 years old. As per <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">reports</a>, Sabrina was struggling to make ends meet and was forced to get into drug dealing as a means to earn some money for her family.</p><p>While many thought her death was an accident, 50 Cent disagreed. The rapper has expressed his suspicion about it being a planned incident.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-what-has-the-rapper-said-about-his-mother>What has the rapper said about his mother?</h2><p>Talking to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Contact Music</a>,&nbsp;50 Cent opened up about his concerns regarding his mother’s death. He said: “Someone put something in her drink and turned the gas on. After that, every time something went wrong, I think, ‘If my mother was here, it wouldn’t be like that.”</p><p>The rapper further alleged that his mother was in a relationship with a woman before her death. He said: “She used to like women. I think she had a girlfriend when I was eight years old. She was really, really aggressive, really manly, really tough.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2023/09/GettyImages-455835418-1024x767.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-the-rapper-has-expressed-his-struggles-while-growing-up>The rapper has expressed his struggles while growing up</h2><p>His mother’s absence affected him badly and there were times when the rapper questioned if things would have been different if Sabrina had been next to him.</p><p>In an interview with&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Page Six</a>, 50 Cent revealed he was bullied as a kid, but his mother used to be scarier than his school bullies. “There’s a point where … I got bumped around a lot in the park, but I was more afraid of my mom than the people I got bumped around by because I could not escape her. Her being a single mom at that point, she was everything,” he said.</p><p>He continued: “She was my mom and my dad, and she was tough so I didn’t know when it was OK to be emotional and when it wasn’t. She would look at me on the floor and say, ‘Get up.” After Sabrina’s passing, 50 Cent was raised by his grandparents.</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFsZmlxX2d%2FcIGPZpqepqSoerW%2BwKCcnbFdnbJussCcnJ1lkal6sLrLsmRxZamarrO%2FjKijnWWjqbatuIypo5qxo2K8r3nHoqpmpZmjsXA%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./christmas-card-messages.html><span>←</span><span>126 Best Christmas Card Messages to Write in Christmas Card 2023</span></a>
