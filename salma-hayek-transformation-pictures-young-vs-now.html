The <a href=#>multitalented star</a> landed her big break in the 1995 film </span><i><span>Desperado</span></i><span>, sharing the screen with </span><a href=#><b>Antonio Banderas</b></a><span>. Since then, she has undergone an incredible transformation in Hollywood.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Salma was born and raised in Mexico and knew from a very early age that she wanted to pursue a career in the entertainment industry. She recounted the story of landing one of her first acting gigs in a February 2018 interview with </span><a href=#><i><span>W Magazine</span></i></a><span>.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>“The very first thing I ever auditioned for was the role of Jasmine in a children’s play of </span><i><span>Aladdin</span></i><span> in Mexico,” the brunette beauty recalled. “I was 18. I had to sing, and I have stage fright. It was a horrible experience —</span> <span>I got the job, but the work was a nightmare. I really suffered every day.”</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>She has come a long way since that role, going on to star in 1996’s </span><i><span>From Dusk Till Dawn</span></i><span>, 1999’s </span><i><span>Wild Wild West</span></i><span> and </span><i><span>Dogma</span></i><span> that same year. In 2002, Salma portrayed Frida Kahlo in the biopic </span><i><span>Frida</span></i><span>, earning her both Academy Award and Golden Globe nominations. In an April 2015 essay written for </span><a href=#><i><span>Marie Claire</span></i></a><span>, the Emmy winner explained why she wanted to take on a role that was different than anything she had ever done before.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>“I was excited to play artist Frida Kahlo, who wasn’t considered beautiful,” she wrote. “She had a unibrow and a little bit of a mustache, but she had the courage to be unique. I think that if you’re confident, some kind of beauty always comes through.</span></p><p><span>Through all of her fantastic <a href=#>career achievements</a>, Salma has had the support of her husband, </span><a href=#><b>François</b><span>–</span><b>Henri Pinault</b></a><span>. The couple got married in Paris on Valentine’s Day in 2009. Two years before walking down the aisle, <a href=#>their daughter</a>, Valentina, was born.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>“We support each other in everything we do,” the </span><i><span>Grown Ups</span></i><span> actress shared with </span><a href=#><i><span>Closer</span></i></a><span> about her husband in February 2017. “We don’t have a strong social life because we really like to spend time together.”</span></p><p><b>Keep scrolling to see Salma’s transformation through photos from then and now.&nbsp;</b></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46smKWlkWK1osXEpGStqpGjwKe70aaYraGfo3qxtcKtrKudo2LGsMHNoGSvq12jvLh7</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./queen-rock-legend-faces-saddest-day-of-his-life-after-heart-attack-tragedy.html><span>←</span><span>Queen rock legend faces 'saddest day of his life' after heart attack tragedy</span></a>
