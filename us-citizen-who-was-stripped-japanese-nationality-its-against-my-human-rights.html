Will Japan lose top talent to Singapore, Hong Kong over weak yen, lower pay?

She became a US citizen in 2004 and renewed her Japanese passport with no problems in 2007.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">When she went to get a replacement passport in 2017, however, passport office staff said they “suspected” she had taken US nationality. “They had done their research on me and I was on their ‘black list’,” she said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“But there are hundreds of thousands of other Japanese who have naturalised in other countries around the world but the Japanese government has no way of knowing about them as most of those governments do not inform the authorities here.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/03/17/a5d0525d-3601-4e61-8d72-efa15f8f0465_f45fa712.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">As a consequence, the Japanese authorities are not able to identify people who have taken other nationalities, meaning the law is applied patchily and arbitrarily. “Taking my Japanese nationality away from me is against my human rights and I believe Article 11-1 of the nationality law contravenes the constitution,” added Kondo, who attended the latest hearing in her case on March 13.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Presently, the US passport holder is required to get a visa to continue to live in Japan as a foreign resident.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Recent precedent is not positive. On February 21, the Tokyo High Court dismissed an appeal by a group of eight plaintiffs who claimed the ban on citizens from also holding foreign nationality violates the constitution.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">That ruling supported a lower court decision in 2021 that stated dual citizenship “could cause conflict in the rights and obligations between countries, as well as between the individual and the state”.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The eight plaintiffs, all of whom were born in Japan but live in Europe, said it was necessary for them to obtain the nationality for the country they were living in for work or personal reasons, but they did not want to be forced to give up their Japanese passports and rights.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Japan’s 2-year ban on foreign students ‘may have driven talent away’</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Lawyers for the group said they intend to appeal to the Supreme Court. An editorial on February 23 in the Asahi newspaper said the nationality law “may be out of tune with today’s world, where countless Japanese cross borders regularly for business or daily life activities”.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">It added that around 1.3 million Japanese live abroad, with 550,000 of those being permanent residents. Many may need to obtain the citizenship of the country where they live but may be unaware that doing so would void their Japanese nationality, the editorial said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">It criticised the existing legislation as “exceptionally rigid and harsh” and called on the government to take steps to amend the law before the Supreme Court is required to make a decision.</p>Some 76 per cent of countries around the world now allow citizens to have dual nationality, often with conditions such as language ability or residency requirements, although it is still outlawed in several Asian countries, <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">including China</span></a>, Vietnam and Myanmar.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In Japan, there is also effectively a two-track system as children born to a Japanese parent and a foreign parent can have two passports until the age of 20 but are then supposed to select one or the other.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/03/17/6b2553bf-7f27-4d86-a425-395479a7af8a_f414ead7.jpg>“I do not understand why they have this rule – it makes no sense to me,” said 23-year-old Alyssa Dunn, whose mother is Japanese and father is <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Australian</span></a>. She often visits Australia “and right now I still have both passports because I have not had to replace my Japanese one since I turned 20, but that will happen in a couple of years and I will have to make a choice”.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">She said she does not want to give up either nationality “because I am from both countries and if I want to work in Australia in the future, it would be much easier if I had an Australian passport that allowed me to live there”.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Kondo said that with the rise in international marriages, thousands of half-Japanese people are going to face the same dilemma.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">‘Not a devious villain’: black men in Japan speak out about racial profiling</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">She suggested that the government does not pursue them with the same vigour as full Japanese who have taken another nationality, and said that failing to admit to having another passport was often sufficient to get around the rules.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Her own case, however, is rather different.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“For people like me, the ministry is being very strict,” she said. “And when I pointed out in my lawsuit that all the other G7 or G20 nations permit dual nationality, the government’s response was that lots of other countries only permit one nationality.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“They gave me the examples of China and Vietnam,” she said. “It’s amazing to me that Japan is using two countries that are not democracies to support their position when Japan is meant to be a nation that is answerable to the people.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kxKaxymaYrKGRZL2mu8%2BlnGiZoqm2pLjEaGpraWNtgXl71KxknKGknsemuoywn6hlp5bAbr%2FTq6CpqJWZequtz5qlnquVYruiwMiopZqkmanGbrXTrGSan5Geu7TAjKawZqCloq6vedGinqGsow%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./650e615cca4741cf778b45d0-html.html><span>←</span><span>Sonora: Acuchillan a alumno de preparatoria en CBTIS de Guaymas</span></a>
