Beside an Instagram snap of her DIY jean shorts, the brunette beauty wrote, “There is no shame in gaining weight during pregnancy (or ever). There is no shame if it takes longer than you think it will to lose the weight (if you want to lose it at all). The Les Miserables star went on, “There is no shame in finally breaking down and making your own jean shorts because last summer’s are just too dang short for this summer’s thighs. Bodies change. Bodies grow. Bodies shrink. It’s all love (don’t let anyone tell you otherwise.)”</p><p>This message of encouragement isn’t the first time Hathaway has opened up about the changes to her physique <a href=#>after welcoming her son</a>, Jonathan Rosebanks Shulman, back in March 2016. Not long after, the 35-year-old told Ellen DeGeneres that despite her setbacks in the gym, she was happy in herself, and so others should be, too. “I normally walk in [my West Hollywood gym] and feel so intimidated,” she said. “But [now] I walk in, I’m like, ‘Yeah I work out with five-pound weights, but I pushed a baby out of my body. I feel good right now.'”</p><p>This article was written by Holly Royce.
