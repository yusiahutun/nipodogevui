You can stop the application process at any point in between without compromising the results, which is impossible with other nail coatings.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We’re all for making DIY manicures as simple as possible, so we set out to find the best nail stickers and wraps of 2024. With the help of Yankee (and four other manicurists) we narrowed down the over-saturated nail wrap and sticker market to just 13 picks that offer countless designs and salon-quality results — all from the comfort of your home.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-overall-color-street-nail-strips></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Overall</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Color Street Nail Strips</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=800 data-sizes=750px alt="Color Street Nail Strips" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/4yr9O0Iseil67x8l6ErwkV-FUls=/fit-in/1500x800/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Color-Street-Nail-Strips-9667b09d1d0c4163b23078fa9b9a9bf5.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Color Street</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>There’s a wide variety of patterns, colors, and finishes to choose from — and many are sold in a variety of sizes.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> The strips are very sticky, so you need to put them on carefully because they’re difficult to adjust once placed.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Professional manicurist and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nocaes>Nailing Hollywood</a> CEO, Mazz Hanna, can’t recommend Color Street Nail Polish Strips enough.

Beauty Gel Nail Wraps thanks to their thicker design. Each wrap comes pre-painted with gel nail polish, which makes them feel a bit more like a true gel manicure (and ultimately extends the longevity). Sold in 14 designs — including holographic and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>glittery options</a> – each pack includes 18 gel nail wraps that simply need to be stuck on and filed down to fit.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Designs: </strong>14 |<strong> Number Per Pack: </strong>18<strong> </strong>| <strong>Adhesive Type: </strong>Stick-on | <strong>Longevity: </strong>Up to 14 Days</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-on-amazon-teenitor-nail-art-kit></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best on Amazon</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Teenitor Nail Art Kit</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Teenitor Nail Art Kit" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/xoUPHyTsu7ohYZHzxvYxLXnrc6E=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Teenitor-Nail-Art-Kit-2c52389c25024fc589550056f397553b.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>This kit includes thousands of nail accents.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> Not all of the decals are stickers, so some require more patience and precision to apply.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Looking for near-instant gratification with your nail sticker purchase? The Teenitor Nail Art Kit on Amazon, which has over 1,500 five-star reviews, includes 12 sheets of stickers (each of which has over 100 individual stickers) along with five cases of sequins (that feature 12 different designs per case). So, for less than $15, you’re getting roughly 1,200 nail stickers and thousands of nail sequins. Talk about a steal!</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">While the stickers are designed to simply stick on, the sequins have to be adhered with top coat or <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>nail glue</a>, making the application process a bit more painstaking. Regardless, though, both the stickers and sequins should be sealed down with a final layer of top coat to increase their longevity.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Designs: </strong>3 |<strong> Number Per Pack: </strong>12 Sheets of stickers and five boxes of sequins<strong> </strong>| <strong>Adhesive Type: </strong>Stick-on and nail glue | <strong>Longevity: </strong>Up to 10 Days</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-bold-designs-sally-hansen-salon-effects-real-nail-polish-strips></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Bold Designs</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Sally Hansen Nail Polish Strips</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Sally Hansen Salon Effects Real Nail Polish Strips" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/wap1Inl14GPIOFd6ESrsjxHTXhc=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Sally-Hansen-Salon-Effects-Real-Nail-Polish-Strips-6c50603759a54454b9f34c1cbe3f5964.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Walmart</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>They’re sold in funky designs and are easy to apply and remove.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> These sell out often, so it can be difficult to buy the set you really want.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-21 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you love bold nail designs, Hanna says to check out the Sally Hansen Salon Effects Real Nail Polish Strips. Many of the nail stickers we found came in solid colors or simplistic designs, but these have more eclectic options, like checkered and leopard print. Each colorful set includes 16 peel-and-stick strips, and once adhered to the nail, all you have to do is file down the excess and finish with top coat — simple as that!</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you see a design you really love, we recommend buying it sooner rather than later as many of them sell out.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Designs: </strong>18 |<strong> Number Per Pack: </strong>16<strong> </strong>| <strong>Adhesive Type: </strong>Stick-on | <strong>Longevity: </strong>Up to 10 Days</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-wide-nails-orly-x-lisa-frank-nail-wraps></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best for Wide Nails</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Orly x Lisa Frank Nail Wraps</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Orly x Lisa Frank Nail Wraps" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/-VEzpVPgKh0pxAq0dDuUlxvMuEs=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Orly-x-Lisa-Frank-Nail-Wraps-c717942544e14c94a48950b3dcabb24f.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Orly</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>The Lisa Frank designs are so nostalgic, we want them all.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> Orly doesn’t have any simplistic nail wrap colors or designs to choose from.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Carmichael, Hanna, and celebrity manicurist Steph Stone are big fans of the Orly Nail Wraps — particularly the Lisa Frank collab. “It’s really catering to the nostalgia in my elder millennial brain,” Stone says.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-27 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">It includes 20 nail wraps per pack, which are on the wider side compared to other options we tried. This is great for folks with wide nails, but not as fab for people with narrow or short nail beds, as the design may have to be significantly filed down to fit. We’re also a bit disappointed in the lack of simplistic design options from the brand. Orly also has a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">collab with NASA</a>, which doesn't have such intense designs, but we do wish they offered solid colors, too, because of how well these fit on wide nails.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Designs: </strong>4 |<strong> Number Per Pack: </strong>20<strong> </strong>| <strong>Adhesive Type: </strong>Stick-on | <strong>Longevity: </strong>Up to 10 Days</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-short-nails-manime-stick-on-gels></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best for Short Nails</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>ManiMe Stick-On Gels</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="ManiMe Stick-On Gels" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/4CuG-pCBPs0_eGDfznhE4cBd_BI=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/ManiMe-Stick-On-Gels-5e24f995ef214e969d43e31a9263b72e.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>ManiMe offers custom nail wrap sizing, so these are guaranteed to fit your nails.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> Custom packs have fewer nail gels.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-31 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Mani Me Custom Stick-On Gels are great for short nails (a blessing considering nail wraps can be a challenge to apply if you have shorter nail beds) but honestly, they’re some of our favorites for all nail shapes and lengths. “Mani Me has you input photos of your hands so they can scan your nail bed size and custom print them for you,” Stone marvels. “[Plus, they have ] lots of collaborations with amazing nail artists to create on-trend and next-level designs.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-32 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The one downfall of the customization?

While the brand may be known for their fun designs, their solid colors are beautiful, and virtually guarantee a mess-proof mani at home. The Nail Wrap Kit includes a sheet with 20 wraps on it, along with a nail file to easily file off any excess.

The reason they’re a bit more involved is because they have to be cured by a UV light (which isn’t included in the kit). Still, the brand stocks a variety of minimalist and maximalist designs in sizes for adults and kids, and once you get over the application learning curve, these are foolproof.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-56 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Designs: </strong>100+ |<strong> Number Per Pack: </strong>34<strong> </strong>| <strong>Adhesive Type: </strong>UV-cured | <strong>Longevity: </strong>Up to 14 Days</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-nail-tattoos-inked-by-dani-color-nail-art-tattoo></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Nail Tattoos</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Inked by Dani Color Nail Art Tattoo</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Inked by Dani Color Nail Art Tattoo" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/td4htegq2djsR2AKBQ062a7L5Ww=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Inked-by-Dani-Color-Nail-Art-Tattoo-890473f5bc044ddb948acea3ead4ace1.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Ulta</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>These apply similar to a temporary tattoo, so you don’t have to worry about them peeling off.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> These fade away rather quickly if you don’t seal them with a top coat.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-59 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you love the look of tiny nail stickers but get annoyed when they start to peel up, check out these nail tattoos. Rather than sticking them to your nail, these apply just like any temporary tattoo, and can be used over polish or on your bare nail. Each pack comes with a variety of fun decals and patterns, so you can easily create a statement mani.

The design you ultimately choose depends on your personal preference. For example, if you like your manicure to make a statement, opt for a bold design: <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Sally Hansen Salon Effects Real Nail Polish Strips</a> has some of the most eclectic options. On the other hand, if you prefer solid colors, the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nocaes>Paintbucket Nail Wrap Kit</a> offers a variety of richly-hued solids. And when you want just a small statement decal, go for mini nail stickers, like <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3 rel="nofollow nocaes">Deco Miami Nail Stickers</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">It’s also important to think about the design, or rather the functionality of the different types of nail wraps, though. “Gel wraps are thicker and give more protection to the nail as well as giving them a plump gel polish finish,” Yankee says. “Wraps made of plastic or vinyl are medium thickness, while those composed of polish are the thinnest, offering the least strength and protection to your nails.” Gel wraps are especially great for weak, brittle nails as they serve as a protective barrier. <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow nocaes">Dashing Diva Glaze Strips</a> are our favorite.&nbsp;</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Stickers per Pack</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Point blank: The more stickers per pack, the better chance you’ll have of creating the nail art idea you have in mind.

That said, Yankee explains that the best way to determine sizing for your nails is by trial and error — just as with <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>press-on nails</a>. “Most strips are on a sheet, though, so you can ‘hover’ the sheet over each nail, which will help you easily select the proper size,” she explains. The trick when sizing is to make sure the wrap isn’t too wide.&nbsp; “If it overlaps onto the skin, it will lift prematurely,” she adds, noting that it’s often best to choose the smaller nail wrap if you’re in between sizes.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-your-questions-answered></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Your Questions, Answered</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>What is the difference between nail wraps and stickers?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">“The difference between nail stickers and wraps is the fact that one offers a full nail coverage and the other is just a sticker focused on decoration,” says Nailing Hollywood Artist, Morgan Dixon. “Nail wraps are used to provide the full nail look and stickers provide more specific nail art you can apply over polish.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Traditional, in-salon nail wraps also exist (but they’re not typically recommended for at-home use). “Traditional nail wraps are technically referring to a fabric coating such as silk, linen, or fiberglass strips cut into shapes and applied to the nail with an adhesive,” Yankee shares.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>How do you apply and remove nail wraps and stickers?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Though each nail wrap product comes with its own set of instructions, Carmichael has a method that she swears by: “Clean the nail to remove any oils with acetone, apply a base coat, and let it completely dry,” she says. From there, find your perfect fit by hovering the strips over top of your nails. Once you’ve selected your strips, peel off the back and press them into place as close to your cuticles as possible. Fold the excess over the free edge of the nail, file it off, and finish with top coat. For gel nail strips, you’ll need to cure them with a UV lamp, too.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The application process for nail stickers compared to nail wraps is a bit less intensive: as all you have to do is place stickers with a pair of tweezers (for precision, says Carmichael) and seal with a top coat.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The removal process for both is relatively easy — nail polish remover or rubbing alcohol should do the trick.
