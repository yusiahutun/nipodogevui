"I had breasts. Like, fully had breasts. I had liposuction. I was 12 years old."</p><p>He said he was very happy about it at the time, but put the weight back on within two weeks, as he "hadn't figured out my relationship with food."</p><p>"Being 12 years old and having liposuction on your chest is quite a big deal," he said. "It was just the basis of all of my teasing, all of my bullying, my whole life, was my chest."</p><p>He remembered having "horrible experiences" at school, when one classmate grabbed his chest and started playing with it in front of all his friends. "That was horrible," he said. "It was f--ked up."</p><p>Even by age eight, he made his mother write notes to school excusing him from swimming, so he wouldn't have to take off his shirt.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:390cdf13-47ec-5cb7-a1ea-d716b74e8ab1 data-container-ref=toofab:article:35617d7d-b3a0-5551-b96e-d4806891a85e data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=28><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/64/5by4/2019/03/14/6425c692e9d757a5a260a0ff68c188e1_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">ABC</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">'Bachelorette' Hopefuls Get Ridiculed by Fans...

I have a very feminine body. When I move, when I have sex with men, it's very feminine. I am feminine in many, many ways," he added.</p><p>He also said he used to send his trainer pictures of Tom Hardy, saying he had to look like him. "But I will never look like that because there's a bit of a woman in me that won't allow my body to move like that," he added.</p><p>"I put on weight in places where women put on weight. And I think that spin-balled everything actually. Because that's me looking at myself going 'maybe I'm not a man, maybe I'm not a woman, maybe I'm just... me? And that's Ok?"</p><p>"And also, how dare I not like my body? That's crazy," he exclaimed. "My mum gave birth to me. She loves my body. Suddenly you are looking at the body that your mum made, and put all that time into, and going 'you're ugly, you're this, you're that'. That's horrible. That's not okay."</p><p>Watch the full interview below:</p><p>Waiting for your permission to load the Instagram Media.</p><a id=gallery-link-56d5c9ac-6b56-5871-b93f-968632a31981 class="media-link gallery-block__link js-track-link js-click-gallery" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:gallery:56d5c9ac-6b56-5871-b93f-968632a31981 data-poster-image-ref=toofab:image-asset:image_jpg_20190315_65176a5f5eb35dbf9f00d5997e11de01 data-start-at-poster data-context='{"name":"gallery-block","section":"permalink"}' data-container-ref=toofab:article:35617d7d-b3a0-5551-b96e-d4806891a85e data-gallery-layout=carousel><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/65/4by3/2019/03/15/65176a5f5eb35dbf9f00d5997e11de01_md.jpg width=825 height=618 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class="media-credit gallery-block__media-credit">Getty/John Salangsang/REX/Shutterstock</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlfnp7j2xmam1fqK6uedKmoK2gXaG2sbvSrpqtoZ%2BjerC6jKGgrGWTnbK0wIxqaWg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./neville-longbottom-harry-potter-matthew-lewis-shirtless-photo.html><span>←</span><span>Matthew Lewis Shares BUFF Shirtless Pic -- See Neville Longbottom Now!</span></a>
