And then all of the sudden, that was my life."</p><p>Waiting for your permission to load the Instagram Media.</p><p>"Who was I gonna inspire when I had nothing in me to give?" she said in reference to a particular relationship. "Like, I let one human being make me so low that I didn't even remember who I was. I was scared to get in the studio. I didn't believe in myself."</p><p>Minaj said it wasn't until she "changed locations" -- first to Miami and then back to New York -- that things started looking up for her both personally and professionally.</p><p>"I started catching a vibe," she said, adding that was then able to crank out hits including "Good Form" and "Coco Chanel."</p><p>Waiting for your permission to load the Instagram Media.</p><p><strong>Got a story or a tip for us?
