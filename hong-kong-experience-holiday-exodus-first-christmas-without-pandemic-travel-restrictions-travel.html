“After all, it is Christmas so a lot of people are looking for a white Christmas,” she said."><meta name=author content="Larita Shotwell"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

This is a big consumer group,” Lee said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“We will need everyone’s participation to enliven Hong Kong and make things more enjoyable.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The Immigration Department estimated that 9.03 million people, including residents and visitors, would travel in and out of Hong Kong during the Christmas and New Year holiday period.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">About 83.5 per cent of the travellers would pass through land crossing points with the mainland, while the rest would be via sea or air.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The Airport Authority said it expected passenger traffic to peak at 160,000 every day with 760 flights during the Christmas and New Year holiday.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The authority, which runs the airport, said the most popular destinations according to the number of flights during the holiday period were Taipei, Shanghai, Bangkok, Tokyo and London.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Among those travelling was Alexandra Berry, who was excited to spend Christmas with her sister, brother-in-law and mother at their family home in Phuket, Thailand, for the first time in four years.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“It feels so great to be able to come and enjoy it together after a few years of missing out,” said the 32-year-old Hong Kong-born resident, who works in public relations.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/12/22/f27afcef-a875-4c1c-9bc7-c614bd379731_fd76b3b9.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">But Tommy Tam Kwong-shun, chairman of the Society of IATA Passenger Agents, had expected more people from Hong Kong to travel over the holiday period – pointing to outbound group tours for December being not more than 60 per cent of 2019 levels.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Being the first Christmas since the opening of the borders and since Covid-19, it should be a peak season, but … it is not really booming this year,” Tam said, pointing to high air fares and economic factors weighing on domestic travel sentiment.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">For visitors, he added, those from long-haul destinations, such as Europe and the United States, had been slow to recover.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Gary Ng Cheuk-yan, a senior economist for Asia-Pacific at Natixis Corporate and Investment Bank, said Christmas was not a holiday on the mainland, and with 80 per cent of tourists to the city coming from across the border, he did not expect inbound tourism to offset the numbers leaving over the festive period.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Ng said he was not confident that the gap between inbound and outbound tourism would narrow, because of the strong demand for travel from Hong Kong, and the city’s lack of competitiveness and attractiveness to the world.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span

class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">He said that Hongkongers travelling to Shenzhen at weekends was part of a wider trend of people flocking across the border and overseas for cheaper and better services.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Therefore, the retail and catering sectors would not see a “significant pick up” in spending during the holidays, Ng said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I do not think that this will be a very Merry Christmas for most of the retailers in Hong Kong,” he said, pointing to rising rents and labour costs squeezing profits, in particular, for smaller businesses.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Economist Simon Lee Siu-po, an honorary fellow at the Asia-Pacific Institute of Business at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, said he estimated a loss of HK$2 billion to HK$3 billion (US$384 million) in retail sales and around a HK$1 billion loss in the catering sector this month.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text

forgiveness in Christmas messages</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Lee said the weak currencies in the region were among reasons that made short-haul travel attractive for Hong Kong residents.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Shenzhen offers a tax rebate, while Japan offered sales and a tax rebate, putting Hong Kong at a big disadvantage,” he said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">But Yeung argued that the city’s Christmas decorations and lights would be appealing for people from the mainland or Southeast Asia looking for the “festive mood”, which they might not experience at home.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">According to a search by the Post, available hotel rooms on Hong Kong Island and Kowloon cost from HK$800 to move than HK$4,000 for a night for December 23 and 24.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Additional reporting by Jess Ma and Harvey Kong</p><p class=postsid
