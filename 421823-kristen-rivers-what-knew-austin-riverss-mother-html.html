They met while they were freshmen in college at Marquette University in Milwaukee in 1979.</p><p class=align-left>During their first meeting, Glenn <a id=http://www.playerwives.com/nba/los-angeles-clippers/austin-rivers-mom-and-glenn-doc-rivers-wife-kristen-rivers/ href=# title rel="nofollow noopener">walked past her and said</a>:</p>You know, you’d be kind of pretty is you washed your hair once in a while.<p class=align-left>Of course, the statement offended Kristen, and Glenn was joking to get Kristen's attention. Glenn later came back and said:</p>Now, I don't want to give you the wrong idea. I don't want to date you. But I have a friend I might want to fix you up with.<p class=align-left>Glenn connected Kristen with his friend, Marc Marotta, one of his teammates, and they dated for more than a year.

Kristen Rivers would regularly receive prank phone calls, slashed tires, and spray-painted her home periodically. She couldn't understand why people were so negative about their unique union.</p><p class=align-left>She saw her husband as a man and not as a black person as the public labelled him. Her stance and courage in the relationship gave it even more strength, and they stuck together for many years.</p><h3>Kristen and Doc Rivers' divorce</h3><p class=align-left>Doc Divers and Kristen Rivers divorced in 2019, after 34 years of <a href=#>marriage</a>.
