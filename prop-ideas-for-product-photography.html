Flowers, Foliage, or Plants</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/003-flower-prop-photo-resized.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/002-flower-prop-photo-resized.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/001-flower-prop-photo-resized.jpg> <span class=txt>Close</span><p>Flowers and plants are often their own subject in many photos, but they—as well as foliage—can be used as props for many products. Using floral items often evokes feelings of femineity, new life, romance, and seasonal changes.</p><p>Flowers are a great prop for perfume products, especially those that use the scent of the flower in use, or even a nice <a href=#>way to photograph jewelry</a>. Dried foliage can add a rustic feel to your photos; this works well with masculine products more than fresh flowers would.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=food-ingredients-or-kitchen-utensils>2. Food, Ingredients, or Kitchen Utensils</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/food-photography-cookies.jpg><p>Taking photos for any food-related product goes hand-in-hand with using food-based props. If you’re <a href=#>photographing a finished food</a>—such as a smoothie or a baked good—using the ingredients as props complements and informs the audience. For healthy food, consumers love to see healthy ingredients in the photos.</p><p>Adjacent to food photography is photographing toiletries. Many toiletries use food-based ingredients that evoke freshness and delightful smells—present those ingredients in your photos.</p><h2 id=books-magazines-or-literature>3. Books, Magazines, or Literature</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/literature-prop.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Books and general literature can bring an air of sophistication to your product photos. If your product is aimed at a market of older, more put-together people, literature makes a great creative prop. It’s especially great for photographing smart shoes, eyeglasses, suave furniture, and the like.</p><p>Using magazines as props can determine the angle of your market. Make sure the tone and reputation of the magazine or literature suit your target market for the product shots.</p><p>You don’t have to keep books or magazines in their final form. You can use curated pages to tell a story—as literally as you’d like to. Or use pages to make a collage or a textured surface on which your product can sit.</p><h2 id=pet-products>4. Pet Products</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/pet-accessories.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>If you’re shooting content for an animal product, whether it be dog food, cat toys, plush pet beds, or something else, then using other pet products as creative props will work.</p><p>Even if your photo’s subject is a pet product, you can set the tone by placing other pet items in the photo. A flat lay works well for this as your main product takes the spotlight in the center and your prop products can side the edges of the frame.</p><p>If your pet is well-behaved, you can even use them as a creative prop, although results may vary.</p><h2 id=lighting>5. Lighting</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/lighting-prop.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>We’re not talking about <a href=#>studio lighting used to light your shot</a>. Instead, you can use separate lighting as a prop. Of course, you can also light your subject with your prop light instead of another light source. Lighting is a fun prop to play around with as results change drastically with small movements or changes to your setup.</p><p>Fairy lights bring a sense of delicacy to product photos and shooting at <a href=#>a large aperture gives a great bokeh result</a> with fairy lights. You can even pair props together—dainty lighting pairs well with traditional literature for a cozy feeling.</p><p>You could also use table lamps or standing lamps as props, even with the lights turned off. These props are great for home furnishing setups, interior real estate photography, or adding a homely touch to other product photos.</p><h2 id=stationery>6. Stationery</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/stationery-props.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Stationery is a photographer’s best friend. You can use it to adorn product photos of technology, anything to do with organization, home product photos, and so much more. Who knew a simple pen was such a versatile prop?</p><p>Using paper of various styles and sorts is a lovely incorporation for many product photos. You don’t need it to look like a sheet of paper—you could use it as a background or an added color swatch. You might add stationery props to your graduation photos if you want to be more creative.</p><p>Adding stationery props is great for back-to-school photos, office products, or even photos of homemade arts and crafts. You can show off the tools you used alongside the end product.</p><h2 id=toys-baby-accessories-or-clothing>7. Toys, Baby Accessories, or Clothing</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/baby-props.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Any baby product photos will always look better with props associated with babies. The same can be said for children’s products.</p><p>While not totally original, baby blocks are a common prop that doesn’t come off as too immature. They’re a sweet reminder of how children learn by playing. You can include other educational toys for a similar effect.</p><p>Be conscious of colors and materials when using baby products as props with other products. If you’re photographing a sustainably-made wooden child’s toy, for example, you won’t help the credibility of the product by using tacky plastic toys as props. The same can be said for props that suggest a different age range than the main product, or a different gender if your market is specifying one.</p><h2 id=tech-accessories>8. Tech Accessories</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/tech-props.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>One of the biggest markets for product photography is technology. With new phone models being released annually, there’s always the need for high-quality product photos, and let’s not even talk about the other types of available tech.</p><p>If you’re photographing a smartphone, why not use its accessories as props nearby? Or use other Apple products alongside the main Apple product you’re photographing.</p><p>This isn’t strictly just for Apple, or cell phones, of course, you can use accessories as props with all types of technology products. Music products? Use headphones, earphones, or even vintage props like cassettes or CDs to highlight music's history.</p><h2 id=human-features>9. Human Features</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/human-features-as-prop.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Even though this list specifies creative props, and humans aren’t strictly props, it’s to be noted that a human touch can elevate product photography. The best way to show how a product works is by showing it in use. You don’t have to be so traditional with this, though.</p><p>Using human hands, even just holding a product, allows your audience to visualize it as a real product they, too, could be holding. You can be as artistic with this approach as you want.</p><p>You can use aspects of the body as props, too. Drape hair around a hair product or rest a pot of body lotion on a model’s midriff. You don’t have to show other body parts because these small areas are subtle enough for art but obvious enough for suggestive use.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=don-rsquo-t-let-your-product-photos-flop>Don’t Let Your Product Photos Flop</h2><p>By introducing creative props to your product photos, you can show a product in use, suggest the feelings your product should evoke, and overall, you can capture your target market better. Some props are vastly overused, but these creative prop ideas can elevate your product photography without oversaturated or boring props.</p><p>Push your composition skills with your prop ideas and see how much your product photography improves.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rq3KnqysnZ%2Bbe6S7zGinq6egYralscCsZJ%2BnomK9s7vDrpqtZaCdvLW7xquYqaCpZA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./zac-efron-girlfriend.html><span>←</span><span>Zac Efron Girlfriend, Whos He Dating Now 2023?
