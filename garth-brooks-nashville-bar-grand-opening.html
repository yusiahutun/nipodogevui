Longtime Nashvillians or tourists who've visited often over the last 20 years will recall that address as the home to&nbsp;Paradise Park Trailer Park and Downtown Sporting Club.</p><p>Taste of Country was there to tour the first floor in November. A large, retractable stage is a centerpiece of the lower level, but it's also visible from the mezzanine/second floor. Multiple bars, ample seating and a dance floor set up the shotgun-style venue.</p><p>Twin palm trees are visible from the stage, but the full tropical experience is upstairs, on the venue's fourth floor. The Oasis Rooftop is billed as the largest in what Brooks is calling the "neon neighborhood." An open-air patio and room with retractable garage doors create a different kind of environment than the honky-tonk.</p><h3>Does Friends&nbsp;in Low Places Serve Food?</h3><p>Until now, FILP has offered a limited menu, but with the grand opening comes options curated by Trisha Yearwood, host of Trisha's Southern Kitchen. The cookbook author and country hitmaker promises dishes like Mama's Meatloaf, fried chicken with white gravy and more for a meat-and-three experience.</p><p>Food will be served 11AM to 9PM. Friends&nbsp;in Low Places is open 11AM to 2AM Monday to Friday and 10AM to 2AM Saturday and Sunday.</p><h2 class=photogallery-title>19 County Artists With Their Own Bars + Restaurants</h2><p>Of all of the side hustles country artists could partake in, opening a bar or restaurant is the most fitting — and very common. After all, many of these stars got their start on a barstool, tip jar nearby, playing their music for anyone who would listen.</p><p>These places feel like home for many of these singers. Over the years, several artists have gotten into the bar or restaurant game, and for a select few, brands have turned into franchises with several locations and/or concepts — we're looking at you, Jimmy Buffett!</p><p>Let's take a look at the country star food and entertainment venues that have opened over the years.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskajBprvFnKaupqSnxm%2BvzqZmoJmiqbVurtGopqSrXaOutLTVoqOlnV2XrrN5xquYp5xdpL2musinnmg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./11-beyonce-and-blue-ivys-best-matching-fashion-moments-their-renaissance-tour-outfits-and-lion-kings.html><span>←</span><span>11 of Beyonc and Blue Ivys best matching fashion moments: from their Renaissance tour outfits a</span></a>
