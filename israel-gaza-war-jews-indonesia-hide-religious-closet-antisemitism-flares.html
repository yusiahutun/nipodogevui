Not all of them yelled anti-Jewish things, but they were clearly audible,” the 36-year-old Muslim said, adding empathically she did not condone antisemitism.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The rally was about standing up for Palestinian sovereignty, she said, not Muslims butting heads against Jews.

relations, although trade between the two is managed through third-party countries like Singapore.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Israeli

data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">As anti-Israel – as well as antisemitism – rhetoric gains momentum in public spaces, Indonesians have overwhelmingly come out in support of the Palestinians, with many joining and advocating for a boycott of products deemed to be affiliated with Israel.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Boycotters have targeted big multinationals including McDonald’s, Starbucks and KFC, and consumer goods from the likes of Nestle and Unilever, accusing them of being Israeli collaborators.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto

affiliated with Israel.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Eager to defang the anger aimed at it, Indonesia’s McDonald’s licensee PT Rekso Nasional

Ulemas (MUI), announced a fatwa last Friday forbidding – or making it haram – for Muslims to buy products by parties supporting or abetting Israel’s war efforts.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Muslim cleric and pluralism activist Aan Anshori, who is affiliated with Nadhatul Ulema (NU), Indonesia’s largest Muslim organisation, however, said the fatwa was “poorly thought-out”.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I support anyone’s right to take part in the boycott, of course, but the MUI’s ruling has muddied the debate and turned a political movement into a religious one,” he said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Anshori said the fatwa could be misinterpreted by Indonesian Muslims as a licence for antisemitism.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In the wake of the fatwa, Indonesians on social media have posted content showing small shopkeepers and individuals chucking out blacklisted household products “in compliance with the MUI’s injunction”.</p><img data-qa=BaseImage-handleRenderImage-StyledImage
