She has an undergraduate degree in economics and a masters in gas and oil economics. For a time, she worked as a business strategist and solar analyst before her move to Los Angeles in 2015, where she would meet her future husband. She worked as a property agent for Rodeo Realty Inc from 2017 and oversaw sales of properties that totalled US$10 million in just her first year of the job. She then jumped ship to the Oppenheim Group in July 2021.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/05/10/180b0045-4443-442b-ae9d-26557b9cdf0a_039f0bbd.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Her business profile states: “Chelsea is a big believer in the power of positive mindset, crediting her drive, determination, and resilience to challenging periods of her life that she’s been able to overcome and grow stronger from, leading her to become the woman that she is today.”</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Topic class="css-1wyvcgo e1b1x8aa3"></span><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Title class="css-i31uou e1b1x8aa1">The Met Gala 2022’s best and worst dressed stars, from Kim K to SJP</span></p></a></h3><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">What about her parents?</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/05/10/9dacc2fa-5aba-4644-92ea-5c5c868e899c_8a66ae79.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Lazkani has proudly spoken about how her mother, Elizabeth Adefioye, inspired her career journey, saying on the show that she’s “one of the most successful black women in corporate America”. And she’s not exaggerating – Elizabeth was named one of the 2019 Most Powerful Women in Corporate America by Black Enterprise and awarded a place in 2021’s Elite 100 Extraordinary Black Women for using her voice to address systemic racism in the workplace.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">According to Lazkani’s work biography, her mother forged a “boundary-breaking career as chief people officer at Emerson” and “provided Chelsea with both the inspiration for what could be possible for her own life but also afforded her the opportunity to travel and see the world, solidifying her love for design, culture and people”.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/05/10/1d5a8905-46fb-4c34-904a-e8e8832ba2bc_966e6f60.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Her father, Segun Adefioye, an accomplished architect and developer, inspired her love for property, according to her bio.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">But the family wasn’t always well off. Her mother worked in a supermarket and in human resources before she climbed the corporate ladder. Lazkani may now spend her days in multimillion-dollar mansions and live in a luxurious home, but she used to live in a London council flat, where she shared a bedroom with her younger brother Richard, now 24, and sister Oyinda, now 30, while growing up, according to British media.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“We had nothing at first. My dad came to the UK with just US$16 to his name,” said Lazkani.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/05/10/1bdd42c0-68fd-4717-be5f-af221820c889_cd532746.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“When I was four to seven we lived on council estates. I remember going to a store and not being able to pick out an extra loaf of bread,” she said. “Because we had nothing, we had to be cost conscious. I always knew the value of a pound. I will never, ever let go of that house. It was tiny, but I want to keep it as a reminder.”</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">And her husband, Jeff Lazkani?</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/05/10/85a563c7-62cb-4dc0-837b-3c7ae0364acc_d7491f3d.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Jeff Lazkani, 40, has worked his way up the ranks to become managing partner at marketing agency Icon Media Direct.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Topic class="css-1wyvcgo e1b1x8aa3"></span><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Title class="css-i31uou e1b1x8aa1">Will Barron Trump go to prom?

The couple now have two children together, toddler Maddox and Melia. Lazkani’s spouse is to thank for her role on Selling Sunset. He introduced his wife to Brett and Jason Oppenheim, co-founders of the show’s The Oppenheim Group, after he used the agency to buy his own abode.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In a conversation with Lazkani on season five, Jason revealed that during a viewing of one home, Lazkani’s mother-in-law told him the property appeared to belong to a narcissist due to the way it was decorated. It turned out to belong to Kanye West.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">What’s her net worth?</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/05/10/2768e60c-6a2f-41d7-be87-eb61bd918ef2_039f0bbd.jpg>Lazkani has been spotted in several designer outfits on Selling Sunset and on her Instagram feed. But her net worth is nowhere near as high as some of her castmates. The likes of <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Christine Quinn and Chrishell Stause are worth millions</span></a>, but Lazkani’s net worth is reportedly US$500,000.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Some reports suggest that, together, Chelsea and Jeff could be worth up to US$1 million. British media has reported that if Lazkani completed a sale on an US$18 million property listing she had in Manhattan Beach, it would earn her US$430,000 in commission.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">Where’s her accent from?</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/05/10/98907481-1923-4566-bdd9-7ff9601d81eb_9ca1e446.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Lazkani’s accent may not be the easiest to decipher at first, but that’s because she has lived in multiple countries. She has, however, faced some controversy on whether she was putting it on for the show. “Guys … the word on the street is that my accent is fake,” she said on her Instagram story to defend herself. “I know it’s all over the place but listen, there’s an explanation, OK?”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/05/10/49a9ff6d-0698-46ea-8fec-718bf1cef63c_0edb78c7.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">She moved to Lausanne, Switzerland for her mother’s job when she was 12 years old, and later to California. “My parents are Nigerian, so I grew up in a household where my parents had an accent, right? I lived in London for the first 10 years of my life. Then, I moved to Switzerland. And then, I moved to New Jersey. Then, I moved to New York. And now, I live in Los Angeles,” Lazkani told host Tan France, per US Weekly.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">She told British media about her multicultural background too. “I’m British, I’m black, I’m Nigerian and I’m also American, I now have an American passport. I’m proud.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kuqKzwLOgp52jZMC1xcueZpydnJqvs7XTsmaaqqSesK2xjmxocG9hboBww8eoZJyglaHApq2MpZizo5Gjtm6%2FxKWjoqaXYsC2utKeq6xlnprEpr%2FTZpqaq6Riuqa5wZ6p</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./warner-music-group-live-nation-coldplay-support-mit-live-music-carbon-footprint-study.html><span>←</span><span>Warner Music Group, Live Nation &amp;amp; Coldplay Support MIT Live Music Carbon Footprint Study</span></a>
