It wasn’t exactly a fairy tale because at the time the young prince was actually dating her sister, Lady Sarah Spencer. The prince, at the time second heir to the throne, was 28 and <a href=#>Princess Diana</a> was aged only 16. The <a href=#>royal</a> eventually broke it off with Sarah, and Charles and Lady Diana Spencer met again at a mutual friend’s home three years later, when she was 19. The rest is a whirlwind romance, <a href=#>royal wedding</a>, divorce and tragedy that we all come to know, written in the history books. However, at their engagement announcement, a comment the next King made had a lasting effect on the People’s Princess.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-diana-thought-charles-proposal-was-a-joke>Diana thought Charles’ proposal was ‘a joke’</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2023/11/GettyImages-52097870-703x1024.jpg><p>After a year of dating, Charles surprised a young Diana by proposing in 1981. She remembered the moment when she retold the memory to Andrew Morton, who wrote the biography Diana: Her True Story – In Her Own Words.</p><p>“I remember thinking, ‘This is a joke’, and I said, ‘Yeah, OK,’ and laughed,” She said.</p><p>“He was deadly serious.”</p><p>But it was their conversation after that upset the mom-of-two, who gave birth to <a href=#>Prince William</a> and Harry.</p><p>“I said, ‘I love you so much, I love you so much.’ And he said, ‘Whatever love means.’ Said it then.&nbsp;</p><p>“So I thought that was great, I thought he meant that. In my immaturity, which was enormous, I thought that he was very much in love with me, which he was. He sort of had the besotted look about him looking back at it, but it wasn’t the genuine sort.”</p><p>At the time she didn’t think much of it. But a <a href=# rel=nofollow>recording</a> of the royal with her voice coach years later, revealed it had a deep effect on her.</p><p>“Charles turned around and said, ‘Whatever in love means,’ and that threw me completely,”&nbsp;she said. The clip was included in the 2017 documentary&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Diana: In Her Own Words</a>.</p><p>“I thought, ‘What a strange question — uh, answer.’ God, absolutely traumatized me,” she added.</p><p>Their engagement was announced three weeks later, on February 24.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-the-first-moments-of-king-charles-and-diana-s-marriage-was-watched-by-millions>The first moments of King Charles and Diana’s marriage was watched by millions</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2023/11/GettyImages-76214539-1024x620.jpg><p>The biggest royal wedding of the century – even more popular than when <a href=#>Meghan Markle was Harry’s blushing bride</a> – was watched by 750 million people. 600,000 people flocked to the streets of London to catch a glimpse of the newlyweds in their best.</p><p>July 29, 1981, marked the moment Lady Diana Spencer became Diana, Princess of Wales.</p><p>They enjoyed a two-week honeymoon on a cruise that drifted throughout the Mediterranean. They later ended their trip at Balmoral Castle in Scotland, which has a special place in most of The Firm’s hearts. It’s where the <a href=#>Queen spent her final days</a>, and where Charles and the other royals traveled to in September to mark the first year since her death.</p><p>It was only a few months later when they announced Prince William was on the way, and he was born on June 21, 1982. Two years later, Diana told the world she was expecting another child – who became <a href=#>Prince Harry</a>.</p><p>For <a href=#>Meghan Markle</a> and Harry’s second pregnancy, Lilibet, they made the announcement on February 13, 2021 – the same date.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-it-came-crashing-down-five-years-later>It came crashing down five years later</h2><p>However, royal bliss wasn’t meant to be. Five years after tying the knot, 1986, they reportedly began living separate lives. It’s believed to be when Charles began his affair with Camilla Parker Bowles.</p><p>But it wouldn’t be until 1992 when they announced they were splitting. Two years later, he admitted infidelity for the first time since the break-up.</p><p>It would also be the same year that Diana was seen in ‘that’ revenge dress. She made headlines in a black dress at London’s Serpentine Gallery. It clearly broke royal rules, not that she’s the only one. <a href=#>Meghan Markle has broken royal rules</a> many times. Kate Middleton was recently asked a normal question at a royal meeting. But she had to <a href=#>refuse over certain traditions</a> in place.</p><p>Then, it was in 1995 when Diana’s bombshell interview with the BBC came to light. Diana’s comment on her and Charles’ marriage is one that was written into the history books.</p><p>“There were three of us in this marriage, so it was a bit crowded.”</p><p>The <a href=#>Queen</a> apparently sent a letter to each of the pair, asking them to get a divorce, which they did in 1996. Unfortunately, Diana only lived another year after the breakdown of her marriage to Charles. The royal passed away in a tragic car crash in Paris on August 31, 1997.</p><p>In 2005, Charles married Camilla in a civil ceremony and have remained together ever since. When he was crowned King, following the Queen’s death last year, she became <a href=#>Queen Consort Camilla</a>, a wish the late monarch had in her final years.</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFsZmppX2aAcLfIp55mm5iWv62x0madqK2iYsSwvsOsZJudlqS%2FpnnDopinmV2irrO%2ByJqenmWkna61ecyasGagkauybrzRnpuim6SasW7A0Zqeoptdm661sY4%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./celebrity-home-bedrooms-photos-inside.html><span>←</span><span>31 of the dreamiest celebrity bedrooms: Michelle Keegan, Rochelle Humes, Ruth Langsford and more</span></a>
