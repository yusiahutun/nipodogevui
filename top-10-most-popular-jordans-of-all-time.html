He had signed a five-year endorsement deal with <a href=# rel=noopener>Nike</a> and released its first shoe, Air Jordan 1, which is still popular to this day. In 1986, the Air Jordan II was introduced to the world. But it wasn’t until 1988 that Air Jordans truly became iconic. A talented architect turned designer named Tinker Hatfield made a bold move. He decided to remove the Nike Swoosh from the shoes and replace it with a new logo called the ‘Jumpman’.&nbsp;</p><p>This simple change transformed the Air Jordans from being just basketball shoes to becoming a must-have fashion statement for the streets. From that moment on, Air Jordans became more than just athletic footwear – they became a symbol of style and culture.
