The challenge was steep for the Volunteers, but they got a big morale boost when Parton walked out on the field, dressed in bedazzled Tennessee orange with a star-studded white blazer.</p><p>Parton was at the Knoxville stadium to deliver a performance of "Rocky Top," a Felice and Boudleaux Bryant classic that's one of Tennessee's official state songs, as well as a fight song for the Vols since the early '70s. But she wasn't the only star power there rooting for the home team: Parton walked out on the field with former Tennessee quarterback and NFL legend Peyton Manning.</p><p>Of course, Manning's got a country connection, too. He's co-hosted the <a href=#>CMA Awards </a>with <a href=#>Luke Bryan</a> for the past two years running; in fact, the pair were in Nashville to host that show earlier this month.</p><p>And although Parton struggled with sound issues as she sang "Rocky Top," accompanied by the team's marching band, her passion for her home state shined through -- and the crowd roared it right back to her. As game play resumed when she left the field, Parton told <a href=#>CBS sports </a>that she'd enjoyed her performance despite the technical issues.</p><p>"Well, it was great, only I couldn't hear because my sound went out and the stadium was so loud!" Parton said. "But I was so honored to be here, and I love Peyton, and I love the crowd. So it's just good to be home always."</p><p>Though Parton's performance left fans in good spirits, the game didn't ultimately go in Tennessee's favor. They lost 38-10 to Georgia, who remain undefeated this season.</p><p><h2 class=photogallery-title>50 College Football Coaches Reveal Their Favorite Country Artists</h2></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskajBprvFnKaupqSnxm%2BvzqZmnaecocZuvMCrq6imXae8pLfYZquoqF2psq%2B6xKyqnp1dq7ytwc2tnJ6qo2KzsLvTm5ilpF2crq6xjKmcsqyfo3qurc2noKefXw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./best-contours-for-pale-skin-1251641.html><span>←</span><span>12 Best Contours for Pale Skin That Are Not Too Dark or Orange</span></a>
