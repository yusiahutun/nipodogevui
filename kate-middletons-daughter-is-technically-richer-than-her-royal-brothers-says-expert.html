A new report suggests the net worth of Charlotte is well over billions of pounds, thanks to her mother, the Princess of Wales.</strong></p><p>Following in her mother’s footsteps, the eight-year-old kid is already at the center of attention. Followers who hail the Princess of Wales for her <a href=#>grace and humility</a> have high expectations from the royal kid. Some experts believe Charlotte could be inheriting the ‘<a href=#>Kate Middleton</a>‘ effect.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2023/12/GettyImages-1841021272-789x1024.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-princess-charlotte-is-richer-than-her-siblings>Princess Charlotte is ‘richer’ than her siblings</h2><p>A study by Electric Ride on Cars <a href=# rel=nofollow>claims</a>, <a href=#>Princess Charlotte</a> is richer than her brothers as her net worth is estimated to be £3.5billion. Whereas her brother, <a href=#>Prince George</a>‘s net worth stands at £3.4billion – even though he is second in line to the throne.</p><p>The difference in the number is due to the inheritance estimate, the study suggests. Charlotte is likely to inherit the ‘highest future inheritance’ which is worth around £3,594,932,000.</p><p>Speaking of Princess Charlotte’s impact, the study explained: “Although her net worth has dropped by 12 percent since 2021, she still edges out her older brother Prince George, apparently due to the ‘Kate Middleton effect’, where the fashion choices of the <a href=#>Royal</a> Family can have a huge impact on fashion trends.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2023/12/GettyImages-1841636715-622x1024.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-charlotte-may-inherit-treasured-jewelry-from-grandmother-diana>Charlotte may inherit treasured jewelry from grandmother Diana</h2><p>Princess Charlotte will have access to some of the most exquisite pieces of jewelry ever made in the world that come to the royal family from her great-grandmother. Reports <a href=# rel=nofollow>say</a> she may also inherit some special pieces which belonged to Grandmother <a href=#>Diana</a>, as per tradition.</p><p>Along with her special inheritance, it is the impact Charlotte has on the world that makes her the ‘richest kid. Since her public outings, clothing and accessories – dresses and shoes – often show a higher demand. Some items even sell out within the blink of an eye after the Princess is spotted wearing them.</p><p>Later, she is likely to carry the legacy of her mother as a royal fashion icon. When her brother George becomes King, she is going to be styled as ‘Princess Royale’ like her great-aunt Anne.</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFsZmpqX2aDcLfArZxmpZmZsa2x06ilrGWUlsKotNOeqWaho2LBpq%2FHp6CcmZyhxm6%2ByJyfnqpdqbWiuoyhnKtloqTGoriMm6morJiav7R50pqwrGWVrb2mvtNo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./lisa-ling-pregnant-80645.html><span>←</span><span>BABY JOY!Lisa Ling is Pregnant With Baby No. 2</span></a>
