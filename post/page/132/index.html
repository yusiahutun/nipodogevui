So, when I got the chance to try Cellfina, the only FDA-approved treatment proven to reduce the look of cellulite for at least three years—in a supposedly painless and minimally invasive way—I was all about it, especially since I’ve had exactly zero luck getting rid of my cellulite on my own, despite working my way through Kayla Itsines’s insane Bikini Body Guide workout.</article><nav class=main-nav><a class=prev href=../../../post/page/131/>← Prev Page</a>
