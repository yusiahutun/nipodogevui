Leaving the house before the pandemic was hard enough, thanks to my social anxiety and depression. But once lockdown started? Forget about it. Being in quarantine exacerbated my symptoms until, one day, I realized that I could hardly get out of bed. From eating and working to binge-watching and texting, I did it all in my bed. I was on antidepressants, and my depression was worse than ever.

The coin in question was released in 2007 by the Royal Mint to mark the 200th anniversary of the 1807 Abolition Of The Slave Trade.
