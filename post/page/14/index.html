<a href=../../../spring-manicure-trends-lavender-nail-polish.html></a>
There are no hard and fast rules about what nail polish colors you can and can't every season, but there's a reason why spring manicure trends are always predictable. After a long, cold, dark winter, ditching your deep, rich nail polishes for pastel ones matches your newfound sunny disposition. Pastel manicures are guaranteed to trend every year, but for spring, lavender is outpacing the rest. In fact, lavender and lilac nails are up 100% in Pinterest search ahead of the official first day of the season.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>What is it like smoking marijuana as a tourist in Thailand?

Much has been written about the development and how it affects public health, taxation, investment and foreign relations in Thailand. But what is it like for a tourist who just wants to get stoned? Can you really buy weed anywhere? And are people getting arrested for it?
I flew to the resort island of Phuket to find out.
A red-light district on Phuket’s west coast, Patong appears to be the perfect place to conduct my research.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Who is Kristen Wilson dating? Kristen Wilson boyfriend, husband</h2><time>Sep 15, 2024</time>

<a href=../../../2-077-jersey-shore.html></a>
The Jersey Shore is not what I thought. MTV should be ashamed (I mean, for way more than one reason, but this is the reason right now).
New Jersey looked every bit like a New England postcard today, beginning to end. We slept in for the first time in a very long time and spent the day doing absolutely nothing. When we woke up we made a quick trip to the pharmacy in this most incredibly quaint seaside town… And found Tony Soprano’s (almost) beach house, Whitecaps, in Sea Bright.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>#969 Cotton Blues.

Since we’re throwing Jennifer and Kyle a supper club baby shower tomorrow night, it dawned on Mallorie and I that we’d need a gift to bring which resulted in a Hattiesburg trip to Target.
We were thinking on what to have for dinner when we remembered that the much talked about Cotton Blues restaurant would be open now, so we gave it a try and absolutely loved it.
It’s sort of like a fancy Ajax with all local ingredients.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>13 Captivating Facts About Metricon Stadium</h2><time>Sep 14, 2024</time>

<a href=../../../serial-killer-zodiac-signs.html></a>
With Halloween mere weeks away, many people are turning their attention to the scary, the spooky–and the astrological. As we specialize in astrology, we conducted a study to identify the zodiac signs of serial killers (at least the ones we know about). Though they’ve been the subject of tireless study for decades now, the building blocks that make a serial killer remain elusive even to the most perceptive and educated psychiatrists, academics, and criminologists in the world—is it nature or nurture, or all of the above?</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Bronco Bowl To Close In October</h2><time>Sep 13, 2024</time>
