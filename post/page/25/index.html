It is natural for humans to be filled with anger and bitterness. As a Christian, do not allow the hostile forces to be around you, as you are required to spread good values only. If you feel you are filled with hate, fear, and negativities, pray to God to remove them. Kneel down and make prayers to remove the spirit of anger and resentment.
Be a Christian with positivity. Do not allow dark forces to thrive in you.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>5 of the best breakfast dishes in Yangon, Myanmar the vivid Southeast Asian city with great stre</h2><time>Aug 26, 2024</time>

From mohinga to tea leaf salad, street food vendors spill from the pavements onto streets offering comfort foods, influenced by neighbouring countries, from early morning until late at night.
Yangon, like Bangkok, is a Southeast Asian city with exceptional street food. Myanmar borders on China, India, Thailand, Laos and Bangladesh, and over 135 ethnic groups live in Yangon, which nurtures the rich flavours of the food.
Street food vendors are masters of the pop-up in this vivid, rundown city, changing location every few hours.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>How to Tell if Someone Is Using Your HBO Max Account (and Stop Them)</h2><time>Aug 26, 2024</time>

Sharing account access with friends and family is fairly common when it comes to streaming services, including HBO Max. While the Terms of Service don't necessarily permit this, we know it happens all the time.

Whatever the reason, there's a way to figure out if someone is using your HBO Max Account and stop them immediately.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>I totally changed my life in 30 days - heres how</h2><time>Aug 26, 2024</time>

This past fall, I found myself growing tired of the quintessentially hourglass silhouette I always recreate in the colder months, namely with wide-leg, full-length jeans, a fitted T-shirt and a short and/or boxy sweater or cardigan. I was officially on the market for a pair of pants with a slim, not classic straight, leg.&nbsp; With the exception of one very tailored jean trouser made by my favorite Milanese independent designer, all the jeans I own come from Madewell.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Jamie Patricof and Kelly Sawyer</h2><time>Aug 25, 2024</time>
