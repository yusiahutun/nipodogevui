With nearly 80 titles in his name, you can find out everything you need to know about the Spanish tennis player.</p><h2><strong>Rafael Nadal Biography</strong></h2><p>Rafael Nadal Parera, the recurring world number one, was born on June 3, 1986, on the Balearic Islands in Spain. He was raised together with his younger sister by his parents, Sebastián Nadal, and his mother in their hometown.</p><p>While his father is a businessman and his mother a housewife, he grew up with a love of sports and tennis. Interestingly, athletics was not too far removed from his family, as he has an uncle who played professional football, Miguel Ángel Nadal, and another uncle, Toni Nadal, who played tennis and was even instrumental in getting Rafael into sports at the age of three.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebily.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Rafael-Nadal.jpg><p>Soon after he started playing as a child, it became clear that he was made for this sport and that he would become a dominant player, although he played both football and tennis. Soon after, he left football to concentrate on tennis, and soon it began to pay off when he started winning championships at the age of only 8.</p><p>Later, Rafael Nadal became famous for biting off his trophies and at only 15 years old he became a professional. In 2003, he was named Newcomer of the Year by the ATP and continued to climb until he reached the world number one for the first time on August 8th, 2008.</p><p><strong>ALSO READ: <a href=#>Who Is Tin Jedvaj? His Height, Weight, Body Measurements</a></strong></p><p>After winning his first Grand Slam title in 2005, he would be in 23rd place by the end of 2017. Of the 23 he won 16 and lost 3 to Roger Federer, 3 to Novak Djokovic, and 1 to Stan Wawrinka. Interestingly, he was able to beat Federer 6 times and only got the last laugh three times against Djokovic.</p><p>In the 2018 Wimbledon Open, Djokovic defeated Nadal 6-4, 3-6, 7-6, 3-6, 10-8 after one of the longest semi-finals of any major tennis tournament, which was Nadal’s first-ever defeat in a Wimbledon semi-final.</p><p>The fame of his career to date is graced by almost 80 career titles that still count, as well as two Olympic gold medals, which he won in Beijing in 2008 (singles) and Rio de Janeiro in 2016 (doubles).</p><h2><strong>Rafael Nadal Net Worth</strong></h2><p>Rafael Nadal is without a doubt one of the greatest tennis players to walk the earth. This has enabled him to make a great fortune for himself. In 2017, Nadal was listed by Forbes magazine among the 100 highest-paid athletes in the world. He ranked 33rd with total earnings of $31.5 million, with $5.5 million in salary and earnings and $26 million in sponsorship money.</p><p>As for his general net worth, Nadal is estimated to be worth over $100 million. Over the course of his career, he has won $82 million worth of awards, which, combined with his numerous sponsorship contracts, has made him a wealthy man. He has had sponsorship contracts with brands such as Nike, Tommy Hilfiger, Babolat, Kia and Gocycle, an electric bicycle, and many others. Many of the sponsorship contracts are still running.</p><h2><strong>Sister, Girlfriend, and Wife</strong></h2><p>Nadal grew up at the side of his younger sister, María Isabel Nadal. Not only have they remained very close, but she is also always there to cheer him up, which is why she is a very popular face at his games.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebily.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Rafael-and-Maria-Francisca-Perello.jpg><p>Apart from his sister and of course his mother, another person who is very close to him is his girlfriend, Maria Francisca Perello. She has been with the tennis player since they started dating in 2005. Before they decided to enter into a relationship, the Spaniards had known each other for several years.</p><p>Even though she is dating a man who is constantly in the eyes of the media, Maria Francisca Perello is completely media-shy and private, which has kept her away from social media so far.</p><p><strong>ALSO READ: <a href=#>Eden Hazard Wife, Height, Weight, Age, Brothers, Net Worth, Religion</a></strong></p><p>Although they have remained together for a considerable part of their lives, Maria has yet to become Rafael’s wife, and an engagement announcement for mid-2018 is still pending.</p><h2><strong>Height and Weight</strong></h2><p>Like many other tennis players, the Spanish star has a good height and a good general build. This is one of the things that, in addition to his skills and talent, has helped him to get as far in the sport as he is.</p><p>He stands 1.85 m (6 ft 1 in) above the ground and has a bodyweight of 85 kg (188 lbs). In general body measurements, Nadal has a chest that measures 41 inches, a waist that measures 33 inches, and a biceps that measures 15 inches.
