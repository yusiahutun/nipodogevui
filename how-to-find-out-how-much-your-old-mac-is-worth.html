You can use this information to work out what you should expect to get for your Mac, even if you want to request slightly more upfront.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>How to See Which Model and Year of Mac You Have</a></span></p><p>eBay is still the best tool for this since it allows you to <a href=#>search for items that have already sold</a> (where money has exchanged hands). Before you do that, you'll need to <a href=#>figure out which Mac you have</a> and what its specifications are.</p><p>To do this, power up your machine and click on the Apple logo in the top-left corner. Select "About This Mac" to see an overview of your machine. This includes important information like your model and size (e.g. MacBook Pro, 16-inch), the year of manufacture (which may also include differentiators like "mid" or "early"), plus the chip, and <a href=#>RAM (memory)</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/about_my_mac.png><p>You may also see the <a href=#>GPU</a> including available memory on older Intel models. Click on the "Storage" tab to see the size of the internal drive (labeled Macintosh HD by default), which is another important piece of information you can include in the listing.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/mac_storage.png><p>Most MacBooks have had <a href=#>solid storage drives</a> for a long while but if you're selling an especially old model that you have upgraded yourself, don't forget to take this into account and mention it in the listing.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=estimating-value-based-on-past-sales>Estimating Value Based on Past Sales</h2><p>With your specs on hand, fire up <a href=#>eBay</a> and click on "Advanced Search" next to the search field. Use your Mac's model as a search term, for example, "2012 Retina MacBook Pro" and feel free to get a little more specific by listing SSD size or the <a href=#>type of chip used</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/keywords_ebay.png><p>Under "Search including" make sure you check "Sold listings" and then hit the blue "Search" button at the bottom of the page. eBay will fetch a list of completed listings, with the most recent listings at the top.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/sold_listings.png> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Depending on how specific you were in your search, you can filter through the listings to find a machine that more closely matches your model including RAM, chip, and SSD size. The price that you see (in green) is the price that the item was sold for. Be aware that some items may be listed as "Refurbished" which will likely go for more than the "Pre-Owned" models.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/finished_auctions.png><p>You can now use this information to get a good idea of what your model would likely sell for on an auction site like eBay. You can also use this information to make listings on other marketplaces like Facebook or Craigslist where you expect the buyer to make an offer rather than pay the full asking price.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>You can use this technique not only for Macs, but iPhones, games consoles, and just about any other bit of tech you want to get rid of. Consider searching for "Completed Listings" instead of "Sold Listings" if you want to see auctions that didn't get any bids for comparison.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>How to See What Something Is Worth Using eBay</a></span></p><h2 id=want-a-faster-sale-trade-in-your-mac>Want a Faster Sale?
