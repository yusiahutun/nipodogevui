In the year before she left, she thought about committing suicide but worried about how the stigma of mental illness would affect her children.</p><p>Julia admitted she tried to starve herself to death, dropping down to 73 lbs. She added that <a href=#>her daughter Miriam</a> is the reason she‚Äôs alive today as she would often ask questions about why she wasn‚Äôt allowed to do things, like ride a bike.</p><p>Once, the My Unorthodox Life star was pulled into the rabbi‚Äôs office for dancing too provocatively around other women. While living as a Haredi Jew throughout the 1990s and early 2000s, she became increasingly uncomfortable.</p><p>Julia claims she was told she hadn‚Äôt been blessed by God with more children because her clothes were too form-fitting.&nbsp;As a <a href=#>married woman</a>, she was often reprimanded for dressing in bright colors but refused to stop.</p><p>Men were expected to study the Torah, and women were to raise large families and dress with extreme modesty. Access to the outside world, via television, the internet, radio, and newspapers, was virtually prohibited.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-my-unorthodox-life-julia-s-before-photos>My Unorthodox Life: Julia‚Äôs before photos</h2><p>In her previous life, Julia was known as Talia Hendler. This was her prison name, she says ‚Äî ‚Äúthe name I had when I was told that I was nothing.‚Äù She wanted to re-create herself, so she came up with a new name: Julia Haart.</p><p>Julia was born in Moscow and moved around the world with her family as a child, settling in Monsey at the age of 11. The eldest of eight children, she is 10 years older than her next sibling and, as an adolescent, became a caretaker.</p><p>At 16, she taught herself how to sew and read fashion magazines in her house. She got married to Yosef Hendler at age 19, who was five years her senior. It comes after she attended Bais Yaakov Academy in Brooklyn, New York.</p><p>Throughout the 1990s and early 2000s, Haart worked as a Judaic Studies teacher at&nbsp;Yeshiva Atlanta. After leaving the <a href=#>Haredi community</a> in 2013, Haart founded a shoe company, which she simply named, Julia Haart.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Some of you may know that Julia Haart was my (very brilliant) high school Judaic Studies teacher.

She‚Äôs always dressed to the nines and is usually wearing heels, which leaves many fans asking just what her real height is. Her passion for shoes began when she was just five.</p><p>Growing up, the Netflix star stayed in an Italian internment camp with her family in Moscow. She told LA Times that a five-year-old boy who ran errands for the camp bought her a handbag that she kept for over 30 years.</p><p>The gesture is what initially started off her accessories collection, particularly for shoes. She added:</p><p>I am five feet tall. If that‚Äôs not complicated enough, I‚Äôm a size four shoe. Between the two, it was almost impossible for me to find shoes my size and I wanted to wear super high heels, but they were tortuously uncomfortable.</p><p>Now, she often dresses up in designer clothes with matching accessories, from a luxurious handbag to a great pair of heels. Julia said she would never stop wearing bright colors, and she kept her promise.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Julia Haart (@juliahaart)</a></p></figure>View Instagram Post<p>If you are affected by any issues raised in the article or would like someone to speak to, please call the Samaritans for free on 116 123.
