New Court. The Inside Story, he is one of two people alive today who were staying in Sandringham House when the king died.

He and his wife, Queen Mary, had been at Sandringham House looking after Charles and Anne whilst <a href=#>Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip</a> were away on their first Commonwealth tour. King George was found dead by his valet in his bed, and it was his wife who broke the news to little Charles.</p><p>The three-year-old was told his grandfather had died by his grandmother (Queen Mother).</p><p>According to Hardman, Queen Mary “explained to Prince Charles that the King had been found by his valet when delivering his early morning cup of tea. Charles listened gravely before asking: ‘Who drank the tea?'”</p><p><strong>MORE:</strong><a href=#> King Charles’ heartbreaking confession about ‘never wanting the throne sooner’</a></p><p>Charles would later make several references to his grandfather. When he was reportedly offered comfort after the Queen’s death and told she and Mary would be “looking after” him.</p><p>He apparently replied: &nbsp;“That’s very kind of you, he replied, ‘but the person whose hand I feel on my shoulder is the King’.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-charles-learned-about-the-queen-s-death-after-hearing-just-two-words>Charles learned about the Queen’s death after hearing just two words</h2><p>After being present when his grandfather passed away in 1952, King Charles had to endure the same heartache 70 years later. <a href=#>Queen Elizabeth II</a> passed away at the age of 96 on September 6, 2022, at Balmoral in Scotland.</p><p>The king <a href=#>would have learned he ascended to the throne</a> through hearing the words “Your Majesty” on a phone call, the addressing of a monarch. The Queen’s passing is said to have been “very peaceful” and she died “In her sleep,” according to a memo. “She wouldn’t have been aware of anything. No pain.”</p><p>The memo would’ve been written by Sir Edward Young, Queen Elizabeth’s private secretary.</p><p>However, Buckingham Palace said it wouldn’t comment on the new royal book as it “does not comment on unauthorized biographies.”</p><p><strong>MORE:</strong><a href=#> Prince William tries ‘desperately hard’ not to think about his destiny on the throne</a></p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFtZmlpX2h9cLfIp55mm5iWv62x0mafmpxdn8K0wIyopZ5lpJqus3nJnqmkoZ6cerLBxKyroqeeYsGwecCsomavmJq7brTIrGSgqpGjsaet06Gcq2WUnrKlew%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./man-26-charged-killing-mom-remains-found-html.html><span>←</span><span>Hawaii man charged with killing mom after remains found</span></a>
