To find the best pairs, we researched cozy options from dozens of brands. Then, we tapped personal stylists and activewear designers for their advice, including insider shopping tips.

We love this elevated basic because it comes in neutral and bright colors — plus, you can choose from a <strong>wide range of sizes</strong> in three different inseam lengths. Available in <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">plus-size</a> and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">cropped</a> options, these pants also have an <strong>adjustable waistband,</strong> a feature Kayla Loken, head designer and founder of Apparel Launch, looks for because it helps increase contrast for easier styling.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">These sweats are made from brushed fleece that feels soft and fuzzy on the inside, with a <strong>matte, smooth exterior</strong> that blends in at the gym or on the street. The cotton and polyester fabric is thick enough to help the pants hold their shape, creating a roomy silhouette that looks great on a range of body types. But some people find that they run large, so you may want to order one size down from your usual.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size:</strong> XXS (00)–XXL (20–22) Regular; XS–XXL Short; and XS–XXL Tall | <strong>Material:</strong> Cotton, polyester | <strong>Colors:</strong> 13</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-budget-old-navy-high-waisted-stretchtech-split-hem-wide-leg-pants-for-women></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Budget</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Old Navy High-Waisted StretchTech Split-Hem Wide-Leg Pants for Women</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Old Navy High-Waisted StretchTech Split-Hem Wide-Leg Pants for Women" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/SKqYLXHt2_2mtowbpK3_ImK1Oro=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/old-navy-high-waisted-stretchtech-split-hem-wide-leg-pants-for-women-17bd48aad0df449f9b06ca473a349bcb.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Old Navy</p></span><p><strong>What We Love:</strong> With subtle piping and a matte finish, these lightweight pants are great for the office.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>They’re not as warm as some other sweatpants on our list are.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Budget-friendly sweatpants you can wear to work? Sign us up. The Old Navy High-Waisted StretchTech Split-Hem Wide-Leg Pants are made from a <strong>lightweight, matte blend</strong> of polyester and spandex that pairs perfectly with <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>a sleek blazer</a>. And they don’t skimp on the details: These sweats also have side pockets, <strong>piping on each leg,</strong> and <strong>a slit at the ankle</strong> to show off your shoes.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you’re always on the go, you’ll love these pants’ four-way <strong>stretch</strong> and <strong>moisture-wicking material.</strong> We’re also fans of the wide size range, which includes three inseam options ranging from 28 to 33 inches. You could buy one in each color and still spend less than the cost of some of our other top picks — so if you’re looking to spruce up your office uniform, we highly recommend clicking ‘Add to Cart.’ Just note that they’re more of a spring and summer pant since the material is on the thinner side.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size:</strong> XS (0)–4X (30) Regular; S (4)–XXL (20) Tall; and XS (0)–XL (18) Petite | <strong>Material:</strong> Polyester, spandex | <strong>Colors:</strong> 4</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-cropped-quince-supersoft-fleece-wide-leg-pants></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Cropped</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Quince SuperSoft Fleece Wide Leg Pants</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Quince SuperSoft Fleece Wide Leg Pants" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/o266nh3cLGEzM3ZNpAHBWi8Fp7M=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/quince-supersoft-fleece-wide-leg-pants-266b6b3e38014e52899e7c81f83947c1.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Quince</p></span><p><strong>What We Love:</strong> These wide-leg sweatpants are both budget- and eco-friendly.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>They only come in one inseam length and they might pill.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">For a pair of cropped sweatpants that feels as good as it looks, we recommend the Quince SuperSoft Fleece Wide Leg Pants. We love that these lounge-worthy bottoms are <strong>made with eco-friendly dyes</strong> and <strong>recycled materials.</strong> The fleece material feels soft on the outside and fuzzy on the inside, although some wearers have found that the interior is prone to pilling over time.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Still, we like that these pants have an <strong>adjustable waistband</strong> and <strong>side pockets, </strong>making them just as functional as they are cute. They’re also <strong>budget-friendly, </strong>so you don’t have to choose between neutral Heather Grey and pastel Petal Pink. Even better, Quince offers <strong>free shipping</strong> and <strong>free returns for up to a year </strong>after your purchase. But we wish they came in more than one length — the 22.5-inch inseam may not suit everyone.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size:</strong> XS (0)–XL (16) | <strong>Material:</strong> Tencel modal, recycled polyester, spandex | <strong>Colors:</strong> 5</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-plus-size-girlfriend-collective-5050-wide-leg-sweatpant></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Plus-Size</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Girlfriend Collective 50/50 Wide Leg Sweatpant</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Girlfriend Collective 50/50 Wide Leg Sweatpant" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/DbAlf8Nzd_8XS9uvA2pQpVJnaKM=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/girlfriend-collective-5050-wide-leg-sweatpant-cd15f243b35746f283af8391c17c0cab.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Girlfriend Collective</p></span><p><strong>What We Love:</strong> These sweats are just as sustainable as they are chic.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>They run slightly short and small.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">When it comes to sustainable clothes in a wide range of sizes, Girlfriend Collective is <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>one of InStyle’s go-to brands</a>. The 50/50 Wide Leg Sweatpant is made with recycled cotton that’s <strong>biodegradable</strong> and <strong>can be recycled</strong> through the brand’s <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">ReGirlfriend</a> program for store credit. Soft and roomy, they pair well with crew necks, hoodies, and zip-ups (or, try the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">50/50 Half-Zip Sweatshirt</a> to create the perfect sweat set).</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We like the <strong>adjustable waistband, side pockets,</strong> and <strong>raw hem</strong> that gives these a relaxed feel for curling up on the couch on a lazy Sunday. The colors stand out, too, from deep Burgundy to bright Cerulean. Ideal for shorter wearers, the 50/50 Sweatpant tends to run short and small — other shoppers may want to order a size up. But with options from XXS to 6XL, finding the right fit is easy.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size:</strong> XXS–6XL | <strong>Material:</strong> Cotton, recycled cotton | <strong>Colors:</strong> 8</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-tall-athleta-venice-high-rise-wide-leg-pant></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Tall</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Athleta Venice High Rise Wide Leg Pant</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Athleta Venice High Rise Wide Leg Pant" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/YtYa7UKh89N7RQDsMoai-JYuz6o=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/athleta-venice-high-rise-wide-leg-pant-9ea346ea40974a538b2e6e7baf8c83e6.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Athleta</p></span><p><strong>What We Love:</strong> Breathable and sweat-wicking, these pants were made for workouts, brunch, and everything in between.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>Wearers say they run a little large, and the waistband isn’t adjustable.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">A 31.5-inch inseam makes the Athleta Venice High Rise Wide Leg Pant ideal for anyone who’s sick of their socks always showing. Sleek and slinky, these breathable sweatpants are made from a blend of nylon and spandex. The Venice Pant is also <strong>super stretchy</strong> and moves with you, no matter what’s on your schedule for the day. We like that they <strong>wick sweat away quickly,</strong> so you can focus on your workout (or your brunch order).&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">With two <strong>drop-in side pockets</strong> and<strong> two zippered back pockets,</strong> there’s plenty of room to stash your phone, hair ties, and other essentials. We also love the <strong>wide waistband,</strong> for some additional support — although we wish it had an adjustable drawstring. Dress it up with a chunky sweater or layer a crop top underneath a zip-up sweatshirt for easy weekend wear.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size:</strong> XXS–3X Regular; XS–XL Tall; and XXS–L Petite | <strong>Material:</strong> Nylon, spandex | <strong>Colors:</strong> 4</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-petite-spanx-airessentials-wide-leg-pant></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Petite</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Spanx AirEssentials Wide Leg Pant</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="AirEssentials Wide Leg Pants" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/93zXFwBdy6vGIzV1tZHRSJMY3AQ=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/spanx-airessentials-wide-leg-pants-5ab5dbbab8604bd5b8e23963b90a3a8a.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Nordstrom</p></span><p><strong>What We Love:</strong> These sweats offer great movement, and they come in a cropped version that’s ideal for shorter wearers.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>They’re pricey and they don’t have pockets.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-27 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">For wide-leg sweatpants you don’t have to swim in, we recommend the Spanx AirEssentials Wide Leg Pant. They’re available in three lengths, with a 28.5-inch option that’s ideal for <strong>anyone who’s 5 feet, 4 inches tall or shorter.</strong> There’s also <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">a cropped version</a> that ranges from 23.5 to 28.5 inches long, for even more inseam options to choose from. With a <strong>silky soft feel </strong>and <strong>great drape,</strong> they were made to keep you cool and comfortable just about anywhere.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Like some of our other top picks, these pants have a four-way <strong>stretch</strong> and an adjustable drawstring in the waistband. We especially love how flattering they are, with <strong>minimal seams </strong>in all the right places. Spanx makes styling these pants easy, with a line of matching AirEssentials tops (including the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Half Zip</a> and the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Turtleneck Tunic</a>).

We love that they have <strong>five pockets</strong> — one on each leg and three in the back — plus <strong>sporty seams across the legs</strong> that set them apart from our other picks.

A <strong>mid-rise waistband</strong> and <strong>sleek vertical seams</strong> give these some serious daily wear potential.

But if you’re dressing up, opt for a pair that has modal, rayon, or Tencel — they’ll feel softer, although you may have to spend a little more, says athleisure designer <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow nocaes">Bryn Gorberg</a>. In general, look for a medium-weight fabric that doesn’t hug your hips. The added structure will help your sweatpants keep their shape so they don’t venture into pajama pant territory, Loken says.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Fit: </strong>Look for a drawstring so you can adjust how your sweatpants fit as needed, Loken suggests. She prefers a 1- or 2-inch wide waistband, but Salifya notes that wider options can add support around your middle if that’s more comfortable for you. Gorberg also recommends checking the rise (the distance from the waistband to the crotch area). If it’s too long, your sweatpants can feel frumpy rather than casual cool, she says.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Inseam Length: </strong>Full-length sweatpants should graze the ground or at least cover most of your sneakers, Gorberg says. For most people, this translates to a 30- or 31-inch inseam length, according to Loken. Just make sure they don’t pool on the floor, or you could trip, Asibey-Gabriel adds. Cropped pairs should hit the middle of your calves, Loken says.</li><li><strong>Pockets: </strong>“I want every pant that I put on to have pockets,” says Gorberg — and we agree. The best pockets are deep, well-constructed, and won’t sag when you tuck your phone inside, Asibey-Gabriel says. Aside from traditional side pockets, a back pocket can add some visual interest, Gorberg explains. FYI: If your wide-leg sweatpants aren’t looking as sophisticated as you’d like, the pockets may actually be to blame. Pairs without pockets tend to have a more streamlined silhouette, Asibey-Gabriel explains, which can be the key to finding sweatpants that will fit in at the office.&nbsp;<br></li></ul><span class=heading-toc id=toc-your-questions-answered></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Your Questions, Answered</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Who makes good-quality sweatpants?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">You can find high-quality sweatpants from a wide range of brands at different price points.
