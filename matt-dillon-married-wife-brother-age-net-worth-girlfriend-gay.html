His star shone in the 1980s, a period in which he quickly developed into a teenage heartbreaker who appeared in comedic and dramatic roles. When the new millennium arrived, it looked like Dillon had fallen off his horse, but like a superhero he returned to new glory in the mid-2000s, proving to movie lovers that he had never really lost his mojo. He had at least an Oscar nod and won a handful of other coveted awards.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Matt Dillon Bio (Age)</strong></h2><p>Matt Dillon was born Matthew Raymond Dillon on February 18, 1984, in New Rochelle, New York. He was born as the second of 6 children to Mary Ellen, a housewife, and Paul Dillon, a portrait painter who also worked for Union Camp as a sales manager. Dillon spent most of his childhood in Mamaroneck, New York, where he grew up as a Roman Catholic. His ethnic background is mainly Irish with traces of German and Scottish.</p><p>In the most unusual of fashions, Dillon was discovered by the cast leaders of the teen drama “Over the Edge” when he was playing hooky at Hommocks Middle School. He got a role in the film that became his debut. Dillon’s performance was acclaimed by the critics, and without further proof, Dillon decided to pursue an acting career.</p><p>As a somewhat stubborn teenager in IRL, Dillon drew on personal experiences and played tough characters, most notably in the adaptation of the novels H.E. Hinton – Tex (1982), Rumble Fish (1983), and The Outsiders (1983). In the 1990s he shone with roles in To Die For (1995) and There’s Something About Mary (1998).</p><p>Dillon added directing and screenwriting to his repertoire and released his film City of Ghosts (2002). His career reached a new level thanks to his role in Crash (2004), which earned him Oscar and Golden Globe nominations. The actor continues to make unsurpassed contributions to the entertainment industry.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Matt’s Brother</strong></h2><p>The other Dillon, Kevin Dillon, who is making waves in Hollywood, is Matt’s younger brother. Kevin, who was born on August 19, 1965, is only one year younger than Matt. Like his brother, Kevin began his Hollywood career as a teenager and has built an enviable resume.</p><p><strong>ALSO READ: <a href=#>Landon Donovan Wife, Family, Age, Height, Bio, Other Facts</a></strong></p><p>He has appeared in several movies and television shows but is best known for his role as Johnny “Drama” Chase in the HBO comedy series Entourage, which earned him 3 Primetime Emmy nominations.</p><p>Kevin Dillon’s other notable works include roles in the British-American war movie Platoon (1986) and the role of John Densmore in the musical biography The Doors (1991). Some of his recent efforts include recurring roles in How to Be a Gentleman, TripTank, and Blue Bloods.</p><p>Kevin Dillon was married to model and actress Jane Stuart from 2006 to 2017. Their union produced one child, daughter Ava, who was born in Los Angeles in May 2006. Kevin has another child, a daughter named Amy from a previous relationship.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Matt Dillon&nbsp;</strong><strong>Net Worth</strong></h2><p>With a resume long enough to rival many actors, Matt Dillon is very successful in his acting career. His net worth is estimated at $40 million as of 2024.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Girlfriend/Wife, Is Matt Gay or Married?</strong></h2><p>As far as we can tell, Matt Dillon’s sexual orientation is heterosexual and not gay. His relationship with several women over the years is the best proof that the actor is not gay.</p><p>At the time of writing this article, Dillon is in a relationship with Roberta Mastromichele. The two have been a couple since 2014 and were first discovered together in February 2015 in Italy and then in France.</p><p>Since then, the couple has traveled frequently to the Italian capital. Mark and Roberta have kept largely silent about the details of their romantic life and have only occasionally posted photos of their numerous trips on Instagram. They seem to share a common passion for photography.</p><p><strong>ALSO READ: <a href=#>Who is Lindsey Graham, Is He Gay? His Education, Net Worth, Wife and Sister</a></strong></p><p>Although Matt Dillon was never married to any of the women he was with, there is speculation that Roberta would be his first wife. The couple sparked engagement rumors when paparazzi photographed Roberta on one of their usual trips to the Italian capital in June 2017, when she was wearing what looked like an engagement ring on her wedding ring finger.</p><p>When her representatives were contacted about the engagement ring, they left no answers. Roberta Mastromichele works as a film choreographer and is best known for her work in <a href=#>Angelina Jolie</a>‘s 2010 film The Tourist.</p><p>Before Roberta came on his path, Matt Dillon had been associated with many other women, most notably <a href=#>Cameron Diaz</a>, with whom he spent three years from 1995 to 1998. Among the other women: are Hallie Eisenberg, Eliza Dushku, Heather Graham, <a href=#>Brooke Shields</a>, Carole Mallory, and Ellen Barkin.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo7XLsmWcp51kuqLA02aboqScpLtuucCrqaKdlGLEqrLEZpmrp6SdsrN5wKCcZqaVqXq4u9Gtn2afmae5p77InqWdZZeWxnA%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./hoda-kotb-cant-believe-what-happened-daughers-birthday-party-video-watch.html><span>←</span><span>Hoda Kotb 'can't believe' what happened at daughter's birthday party - watch</span></a>
