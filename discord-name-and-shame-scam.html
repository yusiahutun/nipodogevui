How should you respond when you receive such a message on Discord? What should you do if you fall victim to it?</p><h2 id=what-is-the-discord-39-s-name-and-shame-scam-and-how-does-it-work>What Is the Discord's Name and Shame Scam, and How Does It Work?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/discord-name-and-shame-scam-text-message.jpg><p>The Name and Shame scam on Discord <a href=#>is a phishing scam</a> where cybercriminals compromise a user's account and send messages to friends. The message appears to come from a friend's account, but scammers actually send it.</p><p>In the message, victims are accused, seemingly by their friend, of flirting with a girl who exposed them on a Discord server. To confirm that it is not them being blamed, the message includes a link to join the server where they are being exposed.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It's natural to believe the message since it appears to come from a Discord friend. Because victims are tricked into believing their friend has sent them this message, they immediately click it.</p><p>After clicking, they are encouraged to scan a QR code to join the server, a trick that scammers use to lure in their victims further. Users who scan the QR code lose access to their account, handing it over to the scammers.</p><p>Once cybercriminals gain access to an account, they send the same message to everyone on that account's friend list. This is how the scam chain goes on and on.</p><p>At first, scammers used to invite their victims to join the same server called "Name & Shame", but now they are using different servers. However, the scam process is almost the same. Be cautious if you receive an invitation with a different server name but the same text. Common server names being used by scammers include "Exposing Creeps", "Discord Shaming", and "Hall of Shame".</p><p>The question is, how do you know if this is a scam or not?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=how-to-identify-the-discord-39-s-name-and-shame-scam>How to Identify the Discord's Name and Shame Scam</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/discord-interface-on-a-laptop.jpg><p>Discord's phishing scams are straightforward to identify since scammers typically use the same text message. Here is what the message reads:</p><p>heyy ummm idk what happened or if its really you but it was your name and the same avatar and you sent a girl erm ** stuff like what the f*** ? &lt;URL> check #exposed and youll see. anyways until you explain what happened im blocking you. sorry if this is a misunderstanding but i do not wanna take risks with having creeps on my friendslist.</p><p>If you have received nearly the same message with a different link or hashtag, that's the first sign of a scam. However, if the message differs, verify it by doing the following:</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><ul><li>Check with a mutual friend with the same contact from whom you received the message to see if they also received it. If so, it's a scam since scammers generally send phishing messages to everyone on a compromised account's friend list.</li><li>Get in touch with the person who sent you this message (through another medium) and ask that person if they personally sent it. If they deny it, ask them to recover their account, as scammers have gotten hold of it.</li></ul><p>Hopefully, those two checks will help confirm whether it's a scam or not. If it's not a scam, and someone has wrongfully accused you somewhere, clarify your position to avoid further embarrassment. But what if it is a scam?</p><h2 id=how-to-respond-to-a-discord-39-s-name-and-shame-scam>How to Respond to a Discord's Name and Shame Scam</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Closeup-Shot-of-Fake-Money-and-Scam-Letters-on-Table.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>To protect yourself and others on your friends' list from Discord phishing scam messages, follow these dos and don'ts:</p><h3 id=mistakes-you-should-avoid>Mistakes You Should Avoid</h3><p>Here are some things you shouldn't do:</p><ul><li>Do not click on a link you received from a friend without confirming it with them first.</li><li>Don't scan any QR code, even if it comes from a person you trust.</li><li>When you receive this scam text, don't communicate with your friend via Discord DM, as you could be communicating with scammers.</li><li>Don't share the message; this way, you avoid others falling victim to the scam because of you.</li></ul><h3 id=what-to-do-if-you-receive-a-scam-message-on-discord>What to Do if You Receive a Scam Message on Discord</h3><p>Here's what you should do instead:</p><ul><li>If you suspect your friend's account has been compromised, contact them by other means and explain what happened. Furthermore, assist your friend in recovering the account.</li><li>After your friend confirms that their account has been hacked, notify all of your mutual friends to prevent them from becoming victims.

You should instead focus on recovering your account. Simply reset your password using your email or phone number, and your account will automatically be logged out of the scammer's device.</p><p>Once you regain access to your account, quickly write a warning message to notify your friends about what happened and warn them not to click on the link in the last message that phishing scammers sent. Additionally, if you own a server, don't forget to check any messages scammers might have sent or pinned.</p><p>Now use your antivirus software to <a href=#>carry out a manual scan</a> in case anything malicious has also been downloaded.</p><p>If you recover your account immediately and notify your friends that you did not send the message, you need not worry about anything.
