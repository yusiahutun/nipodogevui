But today, Philo is actually back with <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.phoebephilo.com/en_us/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="her namesake label" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">her namesake label</a>, which launched at 11:00 AM EST online after an unexpected announcement last month explaining that today would be the day.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=1 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">And there are very few designers like Philo who can pull something like this off. Her devout fans, known as Philophiles, have not moved on from her Céline departure. There are Instagram accounts dedicated to the era, like @phoebephiloarchives or @oldceline, which notes the year Philo worked at the luxury house in its bio like one would life and death on a tombstone: ​2008-2018.<br></p><img alt="paris, france september 30 a model walks the runway at the celine spring summer 2013 fashion show during paris fashion week on september 30, 2012 in paris, france photo by chris moorecatwalkinggetty images" title="Celine - Runway RTW - Spring 2013 - Paris Fashion Week" width=1996 height=3000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-153111003-653f39585ee0c.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Chris Moore/Catwalking</span><p>A easy elegant look from Philo’s fall 2013 collection for Céline.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=3 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">There’s an emotional attachment women have to Philo’s Céline, one that celebrates the fantasy of fashion while still feeling grounded in reality. Her impact on the way women dress and the way they connect through clothing is similar to the foundations built by Miuccia Prada. Indeed, Philo’s clothing wasn’t just for women, it was about women. It was about uniforms, a balance of weird funky glamor, the female gaze. The uninitiated can see it best, I think, in her Spring 2013 collection with its twisted tops, fuzzy heels, and deep-v neck cuts covered in netting on breezy white dresses with raw edges and deep pockets. She made clothing that didn’t require dreaming up an alternative universe for the right occasion to wear.</p><img alt="designer phoebe philo on the runway after her celine fall 2011 show" title="Celine Fall 2011 RTW" width=2832 height=4256 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-1436154859-653f38d11bcea.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Giovanni Giannoni</span><p>Phoebe Philo wearing a pair of Adidas Stan Smiths, a moment that made women around the world question everything they previously knew about sneakers.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Plus, she practiced what she preached. When she wore a pair of Adidas Stan Smith sneakers to take her bow after the fall 2010 show, women everywhere wondered why they hadn’t thought to do the same—and then promptly turned the shoe into a mainstream phenomena. She made a $100 shoe feel like luxury, and her actual luxury garments feel like a non-negotiable necessity.</p><p>Under Philo, Céline was never sold online. And yet, Phoebe Philo is available exclusively online, which feels very in line with how she has always operated. She rarely ever did backstage interviews, always preferring the work to speak for itself. It's also why, perhaps, there's been no indication of what this label would look like or how or when (exactly) it would drop.<br></p><img alt="a person wearing sunglasses and a black dress with a black and white background" title="a person wearing sunglasses and a black dress with a black and white background" width=3000 height=3000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/pp-a1-images-21-653fd87e9add1.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Phoebe Philo</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">If Philo's inaugural collection could talk though, it wouldn't really. The 150 pieces aren't loud but they're not at all the kind of "quiet" the younger generation is fixated on. Instead, the collection has a self assuredness that is plucky without feeling absurd. The clothes aren't the type to get you the "Oh, only you could pull that off" compliment. Instead, they'd make people stare with the intention of wanting to emulate that same kind of deeply beloved Phoebe Philo essence.<br></p><img alt="a woman wearing a black coat" title="a woman wearing a black coat" width=3000 height=3000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/pp-a1-images-89-653fd8650d911.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Phoebe Philo</span></p><p>The latest iteration of this quintessence feels sexy, like a pair of zip khaki trousers with a zipper at the pleat running alongside the back of both legs. You can leave it as is or unzip slightly to make the fabric spiral around your legs like a trail of smoke or entirely to reveal the gold studded bodysuit worn underneath.</p><img alt="a woman wearing black lingerie" title="a woman wearing black lingerie" width=3000 height=3000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/pp-a1-images-24-653fdb0a8b135.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Phoebe Philo</span></p><p>It's also just different without trying hard to be so. For example, Philo offers three different leather jackets: the first with a detachable leather scarf that drapes over the front, one covered in a fringed tassel that looks like thousands of black paint chips, and another with a dropped waist that extends the torso. They're like every leather jacket I've ever wanted but could never personally dream up. Even more daring pieces like hand-combed trousers that are covered in an embroidery with a ribbon base and look like tufted fur have an unintimidating ease to them that's distinctly Philo. They're made with a loose pajama fit, and her model wears them with an oversized button down, as if they were just something you could just throw on with no thought at all.</p><img alt="a man in a suit and tie walking a dog" title="a man in a suit and tie walking a dog" width=3000 height=3000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/pp-a1-images-23-1-653fda37020fe.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Phoebe Philo</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">It’s an interesting time for Philo’s return because she is re-emerging into a world she has helped shape. What once felt revolutionary feels slightly less so because the current fashion landscape is so obsessed with the minimalist, hard to define delights of her Céline that her work is constantly referenced. She isn’t just on the moodboard, she is the moodboard. And this collection will be no different.<br></p><span class="css-1s9owpq ev8dhu51"><img src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/a3e534fd-dc82-4b22-be80-50efa84b1924_1663767759.file?fill=1:1&resize=120:*" alt="Headshot of Tara Gonzalez" title="Headshot of Tara Gonzalez" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Tara Gonzalez is the Senior Fashion Editor at Harper’s Bazaar.
