You’re in charge.'”</p><p>And so the first comedy club&nbsp;in downtown Rock Island came to life in 1990 at The Speakeasy.</p><p>“Since then, there have been nine. Nine comedy clubs that have open and failed, open and failed, and open and failed, and we’re still here,” said Jeff.&nbsp;</p><p>After 20 years in their first location, ComedySportz moved down the street to The Establishment in 2010.</p><p>“We love doing this and never could’ve if it wasn’t for the city of Rock Island supporting us,” said Patrick Adamson, who co-owns ComedySportz with his dad, Jeff.</p><p>But once again, it’s time for a change.&nbsp;</p><p>“This is an evolution for us,” said Patrick.</p><p>Despite all odds with the digital world we live in, ComedySportz has kept Quad Citians coming back.&nbsp;</p><p>“It’s not a format that is one that we can Facebook live stream and try to monotize in some way,” said Patrick.&nbsp;“It needs that person-to-person interaction.”</p><p>But, it’s still tough to keep up with.&nbsp;</p><p>“The digital world completely changed the entertainment landscape,” said Patrick.&nbsp;</p><p>Patrick says with people spending more time on their devices at home, they say these days at least half of their audience on any given night are&nbsp;there for a special occasion.&nbsp;</p><p>So after decades of bringing the people to Rock Island for a good laugh, they say it’s time to bring the show to them.&nbsp;</p><p>“We want to be able to make ourselves more mobile,” said Patrick.&nbsp;“To be able to go to more places.”&nbsp;</p><p>Patrick says with sixteen shows a month and keeping up with a large building like The Establishment, it’s a lot to maintain. So rather than be tied to one place, they’re looking for a more flexible approach.&nbsp;</p><p>Soon, you’ll be able to catch their shows on both sides of the river for the first time. They’ll be performing at The Spotlight Theatre in Moline, and One Voice QC in Davenport.&nbsp;</p><p>“You know to be able to have one foot on each side is like exciting, it’s very nice for us.”</p><p>As for The Establishment, Rock Island Mayor Mike Thoms doesn’t think it will sit empty for long.&nbsp;</p><p>“We’ll see what happens in the future but at least there is some interest,” he said.</p><p>And Patrick says one of their other comedy shows could call Rock Island home in the future.</p><p>“We’re happy to talk about it,” he said.&nbsp;</p><p>And while there’s going to be some changes, this is definitely not a goodbye.&nbsp;</p><p>“We’re one community,” said Jeff.&nbsp;“So what’s good for one city, is good for all the communities. So that’s why we’re spreading out to Davenport and Moline you know? We’re still the Quad Cities.”</p><p>Instead, it’s a new beginning.&nbsp;</p><p>ComedySportz will have shows at The Establishment through the end of May. They will start performing at their new venues in July and August.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7sMHRqqyanJOewaqx0meaqKVfo7K4v46cpqadlK7AsbvRrbFmqaWWsW6vyK2gnqtdobKiwsinnmaqn5i4brXSpZinnF2Ws7Wx0WZpcmWpmq6zv44%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./birthstone-march-aquamarine-jewelry.html><span>←</span><span>Aquamarine</span></a>
