His quotes on libraries are both inspiring and enlightening, capturing the magic and importance of these institutions.</p><ul><li>Google can bring you back 100,000 answers. A librarian can bring you back the right one.</li><li>It's still National Library Week. You should be especially nice to a librarian today or tomorrow. Sometime this week, anyway. Probably the librarians would like tea. Or chocolates. Or a reliable source of funding.</li><li>A library is a place that is a repository of information and gives every citizen equal access to it. That includes health information.</li><li>The library was open, which meant that it was open to whoever wanted to come in and read whatever books they wanted. It was and remains a beautiful thing.</li><li>Libraries are the one American institution you shouldn't rip off.</li><li>I love libraries. I love the smell of books. I love the feel of them. I love the musty smell of the stacks. I love the creak of the floors. I love the librarians. I love how they get excited when they find a book they think you'll like.</li><li>Libraries are the best things in the world. They're like a great big hug and a "Welcome home."</li><li>I see libraries and librarians as frontline soldiers in the war against illiteracy and the lack of imagination.</li><li>If you do not value libraries, you do not value information, culture, or wisdom. You are silencing the voices of the past, and you are damaging the future.</li><li>I was the kind of kid whose parents would drop him off at the local town library on their way to work, and I'd go and work my way through the children's area.</li><li>Libraries are our friends.</li><li>Reading is essential. Books are important. Librarians are important. (Also, libraries are not child-care facilities, but sometimes feral children raise themselves among the stacks.)</li><li>He would go somewhere no one knew him and sit in a library all day, read books, and listen to people breathing.</li><li>For me, closing libraries is the equivalent of eating your seed corn to save a little money.</li><li>Libraries are the gate to the future.</li></ul><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/b3780b168bf2d668.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>100+ inspirational nature status to caption photos of plants and animals</span></p></a><h2>Neil Gaiman quotes on stories and books</h2><p class=align-left>Stories are a powerful thing in the world. They can change the way we see the world and ourselves. Neil Gaiman, a master storyteller, reminds us of the power and magic of storytelling through his books.</p><ul><li>Stories may well be lies, but they are good lies that say true things and can sometimes pay rent.</li><li>We owe it to each other to tell stories.</li><li>I lived in books more than I lived anywhere else.</li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/f0cb289f7684ac4d.jpg><ul><li>Never trust the storyteller. Only trust the story.</li><li>I liked myths. They weren't adult stories, and they weren't children's stories. They were better than that. They just were.</li><li>I think short stories are a very underrated art form. We know that novels deserve respect.</li><li>I say that a town isn't a town without a bookstore. It may call itself a town, but unless it's got a bookstore, it knows it's not fooling a soul.</li><li>Stories you read when you're the right age never quite leave you. You may forget who wrote them or what the story was called. Sometimes you'll forget precisely what happened, but if a story touches you, it will stay with you, haunting the places in your mind you rarely visit.</li><li>Growing up, I took so many cues from books. They taught me most of what I knew about what people did, about how to behave. They were my teachers and my advisers.</li><li>Stories are like spiders, with all their long legs, and stories are like spiderwebs, which man gets himself all tangled up in but which look pretty when you see them under a leaf in the morning dew, and in the elegant way that they connect to one another, each to each.</li><li>It's not irrelevant, those moments of connection, those places where fiction saves your life. It's the most important thing there is.</li><li>A novel seemed the easiest way to get what I had in my head into the inside of other people's heads. Books are good that way.</li><li>Picking five <a href=#>favourite books</a> is like picking the five body parts you'd most like not to lose.</li><li>Books make great gifts because they have whole worlds inside of them. And it's much cheaper to buy somebody a book than to buy them the whole world.</li><li>I went away in my head into a book. That was where I went whenever real life was too stiff or inflexible.</li></ul><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/79fef1a2cb93b996.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=29><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>50+ Zulu proverbs and sayings about love, life, and death</span></p></a><h2>Thoughtful Neil Gaiman quotes about writing and writers</h2><p class=align-left>The master of words and weaving tales captivates and inspires many writers. His quotes on writing are a testament to his passion for writing and the power of the <a href=#>written word</a>. These quotes will surely blow your mind to read more of Neil's quotes.</p><ul><li>Writing is flying in dreams. When you remember. When you can. When it works, it's that easy.</li><li>I will write in words of fire. I will write them on your skin. I will write about desires. Write beginnings, write of sin. You are the best book I love; your skin only holds my truth. You will be a palimpsest line of age writing youth.</li><li>Rule one. You have to write. If you don't write, nothing will happen.</li><li>Know the rules safely, then break them with joy.</li><li>You learn more from finishing a failure than you do from writing a success.</li><li>And then what happened? Those words, I think, are the most important words there are for a storyteller. Anything you can do to keep people turning the pages is legitimate.</li><li>Being a writer is a peculiar sort of job. It's always you versus a blank sheet of paper (or a blank screen), and quite often, the blank piece of paper wins.</li><li>The main rule of writing is that if you do it with enough assurance and confidence, you can do whatever you like. (That may be a rule for life as well as for writing. But it's true for writing.) So write your story as it needs to be written. Write it honestly, and tell it as best you can. I'm not sure that there are any other rules. Not ones that matter.</li><li>Tomorrow may be hell, but today was a good writing day, and on good writing days, nothing else matters.</li><li>Finish what you're writing. Whatever you have to do to finish it, finish it.</li><li>All writers have this vague hope that the elves will come in the night and finish any stories.</li><li>All fiction is a process of imagining: whatever you write, in whatever genre or medium, your task is to make things up convincingly and interestingly and new.</li><li>I'm writing. The pages are starting to stack up. My morale is improving the more I feel like a writer.</li><li>Remember that, sooner or later, before it ever reaches perfection, you will have to let it go, move on, and start to write the next thing. Perfection is like chasing the horizon. Keep moving.</li></ul><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/ebd0be759f3e2e8b.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=29><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>50+ best African proverbs about life, hard times, and death</span></p></a><h2>Neil Gaiman quotes about love</h2><p class=align-left>Neil's iconic words combine wisdom, wit, and emotion to capture love's essence in all its forms. From the power of connection to the sacrifice of the heart, his quotes will inspire and challenge your understanding of love as they also leave you enchanted.</p><ul><li>I really don't know what I love you means. I think it means, "don't leave me here alone."</li><li>My heart. It feels like my chest can barely contain it. Like it's trying to escape because it doesn't belong to me any more. It belongs to you.</li><li>You can't make me love you.</li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/b41c53de24a7f655_b.jpg><ul><li>He wondered how it could have taken him so long to realize he cared for her, and he told her so, and she called him an idiot, and he declared that it was the finest thing ever that a man had reached.</li><li>Have you ever been in love? Horrible, isn't it? It makes you so vulnerable. It opens your chest and heart and means someone can get inside you and mess you up.</li><li>Love me when I least deserve it because that's when I need it.</li><li>She seems cool, focused, and quiet, yet her eyes remain fixed on the horizon. You think you know all there is to know about her immediately upon meeting her, but everything you think you know is wrong. Passion flows through her like a river of blood. She only looked away for a moment, and the mask slipped, and you fell. All your tomorrows start here.</li><li>You know how is it when you love someone? And the hard part, the bad part, the Jerry Springer Show part, is that you never stop loving someone. There's always a piece of them in your heart.</li><li>Then, one stupid person, no different from any other stupid person, wanders into your stupid life. You give them a piece of you. They don't ask for it. They do something dumb one day, like kiss or smile at you, and your life isn't your own anymore.</li><li>Every lover is, in his heart, a madman and, in his head, a minstrel.</li></ul><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/fa51becc7f79a536.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>10 books that make you think about love in a different way</span></p></a><h2>Neil Gaiman's thoughts on life</h2><p class=align-left>The celebrity’s life quotes reflect his unique perspective on the world. They offer insight into the human experience. They are often profound, wise, and inspiring, making them a great source of inspiration for anyone looking to navigate the complexities of life.</p><ul><li>Life is a game, that life is a cruel joke, and that life is what happens when you're alive and that you might as well lie back and enjoy it.</li><li>We make choices. No one else can live our lives for us. And we must confront and accept the consequences of our actions.</li><li>You don't get explanations in real life. You just get moments that are utterly, inexplicably odd.</li><li>Life is a disease. Sexually transmitted and invariably fatal.</li><li>Every hour wounds. The last one kills.</li></ul><p class=align-left>Neil Gaiman quotes will inspire you to see the beauty in the world around you, embrace your dreams, and always hold on to the power of love.
