I don’t know what it was with Vanessa, but we kind of clicked from the very beginning.”</p><p>The two confirmed their relationship in March 2007 after Efron starred as Hudgens’ love interest in her “Say Ok” music video. A representative for Hudgens told <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">AOL</a> at the time that the music video was the couple’s “official coming out.” In an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">People</a> in 2009, Hudgens denied rumors she and Efron were engaged. “I think [marriage and starting a family] is great but I’m so focused on my career right now that it doesn’t really cross my mind,” she said at the time.</p><p>In an interview with Details in August 2010, months before his and Hudgens’ breakup, Efron revealed that he questioned if he should be single. “Yeah, everyone tells me that. I think a lot of guys would enjoy that. But I’m not really like that … I rack my brain thinking, ‘Why am I not out there playing the field?’ One of my buddies was like, ‘You have no idea what’s going on right now.’ … But it’s not in my heart,” he said. News broke of Efron and Hudgens’ breakup in December 2010. “They are 100 percent still good friends,” a source told <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">People</a> at the time. “We’re still friends. Who knows what the future will bring. We’re figuring things out,” Hudgens told Details at the time. She also explained in another interview at the time that long-distance played a role in their relationship. “Long-distance relationships are hard no matter what. When you don’t have face-to-face time, it’s just different. Having an iPhone helped, but it just wasn’t the same,” she said.</p><p>In April 2014, Efron revealed that he was no longer in touch with Hudgens. “She was a really interesting, sweet person,” he told <a href=# rel=noopener>The Hollywood Reporter</a> at the time. A year later, Hudgens told <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">The New York Times</a> about how jealousy affected their relationship. “I went through a phase when I was really mean because I was so fed up. Girls were running after him, and I was giving them death stares. Then I realized that’s not what that’s about,” she said. Hudgens also confirmed to Access Hollywood in 2017 that she and Efron no longer spoke. “Oh, yeah, no … That’s not a thing that happens. I completely lost contact with him,” she said. Though the two lost touch, Hudgens expressed “gratitude” for her relationship with Efron in an interview with The Hollywood Reporter in 2019. “I could not have been more grateful to have that relationship at the time … It was this massive phenomenon and [all] eyes were on me. And it’s just a really weird foreign thing to go through, and by being in a relationship, it kind of kept me stabilized and grounded, and I had someone to lean on who was going through it as well,” she said. Efron re-followed Hudgens on Instagram in April 2023, more than 12 years after their breakup.</p><p>High School Musical<span> is available to stream on </span><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Disney Plus</a><span>.
