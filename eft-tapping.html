It is often referred to as “tapping therapy” and is based on the principles of acupuncture and energy psychology. EFT Tapping is a kind of mind-body therapy, wherein you tap certain meridian points on your body while focusing on your uncomfortable thoughts. It is supposed to provide a kind of emotional release.&nbsp;</p><h4 class=wp-block-heading>The Process</h4><p>EFT works on the mind-body connection. Even though our mind is not a tangible entity, it is still very much a part of and connected to our body. EFT proposes that tapping certain specific points on our body, such as the side of our eyes, our eyebrows, the top of the head, etc. can help to release our mental discomfort.</p><p>The first step is to identify the problem, issue or negative thought pattern that we want to fix. Acknowledge the issue; say it out loud while simultaneously tapping the meridian points (top of the head, eyebrows, collarbone, etc.). An affirmative statement of <a href=#>self-acceptance</a> then follows, to replace the negative thought process. After completing a round of tapping, the intensity of their emotional or physical discomfort is assessed on a scale from 0 to 10. If there is still work to be done, the process can be repeated a few times.</p><h4 class=wp-block-heading>How does it Work?&nbsp;</h4><p>Acupuncture is based on the concept of Qi, which is believed to be the vital energy that flows through the body along pathways called meridians. Certain points in this pathway can be stimulated (using needles or by tapping them lightly) to trigger the release of certain neurochemicals. This release of neurochemicals does help to strengthen the scientific basis of this technique.&nbsp;</p><p>Critics of this technique argue that it works mainly on <a href=#>the placebo effect</a>, which essentially means that it works only because the person is expecting it to work. The principle at work here is that you convince yourself so fully that the process will work, that it does end up working.&nbsp;</p><p>However, research conducted does show the positive benefits of EFT. Research on Emotional Freedom Techniques (EFT) found that having 4 to 10 sessions can help people with <a href=#>PTSD</a>. Different studies looked at this and found it works well for different groups of people. They also found that using EFT didn’t cause any bad effects. People could use it by themselves or as the main treatment for PTSD, based on evidence from studies. “Vision improved, headaches disappeared, cancer pains and symptoms subsided and so on..”; all of these are claimed by the sixth edition of the EFT manual to be the positives of EFT!</p><h5 class=wp-block-heading>Can you perform it on yourself?</h5><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.psychologs.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/EFT-Tapping-Process.jpg><p>Yes! EFT is a relatively easy procedure that you can try to reduce and manage your daily <a href=#>stresses</a> and <a href=#>anxiety</a>. Being a relatively easy technique, it allows you the flexibility to practice it when and wherever you get the time. There are many apps and manuals that you can find online that will guide you through the entire step. Here is a small, simple rundown of the process of EFT to try if you’re interested.&nbsp;</p><ul><li><strong>Identify the Issue:</strong> Think about what’s bothering you. It could be stress, anxiety, pain, or any negative emotion.</li><li><strong>Setup Statement:</strong> Create a short phrase that describes the issue and how you feel about it. For example, “Even though I feel anxious about my presentation, I accept myself and how I feel.”</li><li><strong>Tap on Acupressure Points: </strong>Use your fingertips to tap gently on specific points on your body while repeating your setup statement.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Repeat: </strong>Tap each point around 5-7 times while repeating your setup statement or any related phrase.</li><li><strong>Check-in:</strong> After a round of tapping, take a deep breath and assess how you feel. If you’re still feeling bothered, repeat the process with a new setup statement until you feel better.</li><li><strong>End with Positive Affirmation: </strong>Once you feel calmer, end your session with a positive affirmation, such as “I am calm and in control.”</li></ul><p>Remember, EFT works best when you’re honest with yourself about your feelings and open to the process. Be sure to practice it regularly to experience its benefits.</p><h5 class=wp-block-heading>Meridian Points for EFT tapping</h5><p>As discussed above, meridians are pathways through which the body’s vital energy, called “qi” flows. There are believed to be several meridians in the body, each associated with different organs and functions. Meridian points are points along these pathways where the energy is said to be concentrated. The following are the meridian points that you can use while EFT tapping –&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.psychologs.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Meridian-Points-for-EFT-tapping.jpg><ul><li><strong>Top of the Head:</strong> Tap with your fingertips at the crown of your head.</li><li><strong>Eyebrow: </strong>the beginning of your eyebrow, near the bridge of your nose.</li><li><strong>Side of the Eye: </strong>the bone at the outer edge of your eye.</li><li><strong>Under the Eye: </strong>the bone directly under your eye.</li><li><strong>Under the Nose: </strong>the space between your nose and upper lip.</li><li><strong>Chin: </strong>the crease between your lower lip and chin.</li><li><strong>Collarbone: </strong>either side of your collarbone, about an inch below where the collarbone meets the sternum.</li><li><strong>Under the Arm: </strong>about four inches below your armpit.</li></ul><h4 class=wp-block-heading>Take Away</h4><p>In this article we discuss the Emotional Freedom Technique that works as an alternative form of therapy, helping especially with anxiety and Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. It talks about the process of EFT and discusses its reliability. We also give a little rundown procedure for everyone curious about EFT and willing to try it out, along with the points to be tapped.</p><p><strong>Read More Articles From Psychology</strong></p>References +<ul><li>EFT International.
