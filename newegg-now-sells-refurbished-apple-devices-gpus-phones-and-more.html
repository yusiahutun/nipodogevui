Additionally, this new initiative expands its GPU trade-in system to other PC parts, giving gamers and users more ways to save.</p><p>"We're focused on expanding our refreshed categories to offer our customers both great value and peace of mind when they choose like-new or refurbished products. We're launching a program that offers customers additional ways to save, whether in the form of Newegg Refreshed products or trade-in credit, while promoting sustainability," said Andrew Choi, Director of Brand Marketing and Web Experience.</p><p>According to its press release, Newegg and its partners will professionally inspect, test, clean, and fix or refurbish parts as necessary, then ensure proper working order. From here, each product is backed by the Newegg Refreshed Guarantee, comes with any essential accessories, and has a 90-day warranty for refund or replacement.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>These partners include ABS, Likewize, Back in the Box, CTS Warehouse Store, Focus Camera, and iRobot, to name a few. Still, the company didn't share any other details about the refurbishment process. Either way, trading in an old GPU for a new one is great, but finding a gently used model at an even bigger discount is better. More importantly, it's nice to see a 90-day return period for refreshed tech, which matches or exceeds most of the compeittion. Woot, the Amazon-owned site that sells many refurbished products, has <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored nofollow" class="norewrite noskim">a standard return policy of 30 days</a> with product-specific extensions that are sometimes longer.</p><p>So, let Newegg's new AI tool <a href=#>help you pick the best PC parts</a>, then try to find them refurbished, and you'll quickly have a capable yet affordable machine. The <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored nofollow" class="norewrite noskim">Newegg Refreshed list</a> currently shows a wide range of products, including headphones, earbuds, smartwatches, GPUs, entire PC systems, and much more.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Source: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">PRNewswire</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvWraagnZWge6S7zGilnq%2BVnLRuus6wZKydnKHAbr7En6yrmpmotaawjJqnqaSVYrGmwsicnKxll6XCtHnPoaannaNirq%2BwjKamq51f</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./assemble-anycubic-kobra-neo-3d-print-first-model.html><span>←</span><span>How to Assemble the Anycubic Kobra Neo and 3D Print Your First Model</span></a>
