She was slim and pretty, with dark hair and green eyes.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘I am a journalist and I want to do a story on you.

Her name was Ann Hills, she specialised in writing about social policy issues and the interview — which he gave her — was on his pet subject, the rights of disabled people.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Like Tony, she was short, 4ft 10in. Like him, too, she had a voracious appetite for sex and boasted she could get any man into bed within five minutes of meeting him.</p><h2>RELATED ARTICLES</h2><ul class="rotator-pages link-xocc"><li class=rotator-prev><a href=# data-page=prev>Previous</a></li><li><a href=# data-page=1>1</a></li><li class=rotator-next><a href=# data-page=next>Next</a></li></ul><ul class="rotator-panels link-bogr1 linkro-ccox"><li><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/01/18/18/3C3EE8A500000578-0-image-m-12_1484762639773.jpg width=62 height=60 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto> <span>'Extremely sad' Princess Tessy, 31, of Luxembourg announces...</span></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/01/18/14/3C3DBF7500000578-0-image-m-26_1484749323244.jpg width=62 height=60 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto> <span>A grey day?

Ann would visit Tony or he would go round to her flat in the morning.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>It was easy during school term time; more difficult if her sons were at home. On those occasions, they were sent into the garden to play.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>When Ann and Tony met, she knew he was in a relationship with his assistant, Lucy Lindsay-Hogg, but thought it was just another fling. She was miserable when she opened a newspaper, in December 1978, and read that they had married.</p><img id=i-3cb82823654b574e src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/01/18/23/3C1A898C00000578-4134246-image-a-79_1484782853531.jpg height=986 width=634 alt="Lord Snowdon, 86, was seen with his ex-wife of 22 years, Lucy Lindsay-Hogg before he died" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>Lord Snowdon, 86, was seen with his ex-wife of 22 years, Lucy Lindsay-Hogg before he died</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>What Ann had not realised, when she’d embarked on their affair 18 months earlier, was how much Tony would come to mean to her. ‘I cannot break off this relationship,’ she told a friend. ‘It is absolutely vital to my being — to my life.’</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Sometimes, she would go to see him at his home in Launceston Place, Kensington, under the pretext of helping him write his speeches on the disabled. This excuse was all the more convincing because it was true.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>As such, her presence in the house was accepted without suspicion by Lucy. But the lovers’ trysts were not nearly as frequent as Ann wished. She wanted more. She was also unhappy that they could not be together openly. Once, she said sadly to a friend: ‘He’s just driven past me — and I couldn’t even wave.’</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>She continued to have other lovers, some casual, others living with her. But Tony was her priority and she told the live-in lovers to ‘disappear’ when he visited her.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>When her father remonstrated with her about the affair, saying ‘He’s got a wife and child,’ she replied: ‘Well, he can break it off, but I’m not going to.’</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Tony never did, and the affair continued for an astonishing 20 years, all the time behind his wife’s back. Disaster, however, was always just around the corner — and on New Year’s Eve, 1996, it struck.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Although still deeply in love with Tony, Ann’s life had gone into a downward spiral.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>She worked as a freelance journalist, but had been sacked from a long-standing column in The Guardian. A live-in lover had broken up with her because she could not give him children, and her latest relationship was falling apart. She was 55 and hated the prospect of a dwindling succession of lovers as she aged.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>As for Tony, she told a friend: ‘I’m feeling really p***ed off about this affair. At the best of times, I don’t see him nearly enough. And at Christmas, naturally, he’s got to be with his family.’</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Her Christmas was spent with her ex-husband and their grown-up children. Then, on December 29, she took her elderly father to the theatre. He was aware his daughter’s self-esteem was at rock bottom.</p><img id=i-b3793d7de7968d85 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/01/19/01/008AAD7B00000190-4134246-After_Lord_Snowdon_and_Princess_Margaret_separated_in_1976_he_la-a-83_1484787906859.jpg height=835 width=634 alt="After Lord Snowdon and Princess Margaret separated in 1976, he later married Lucy Lindsay-Hogg (pictured)" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>After Lord Snowdon and Princess Margaret separated in 1976, he later married Lucy Lindsay-Hogg (pictured)</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘She could not face not being a success at journalism,’ he said. ‘She also worried about the prospect of not having a man in her home.’</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>It was then that, desperately lonely, she rang asking Tony to call her, which he did. She did not pick up and he left her a message saying he would love to see her after New Year and that he was concerned about her. He ended: ‘Chin up!’</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>On New Year’s Eve, a friend rang to invite Ann over, got her answering machine and felt worried. She contacted Ann’s father and together they went round to her mansion-block flat in Marylebone.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>On the kitchen table was a suicide note, telling of her problems and asking for a brooch Tony had given her to be returned to him, along with a note saying she had always loved him and always would.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>There was no sign of Ann, however, until her father went out on to the flat’s roof terrace. It was a freezing night with a sprinkling of snow. Ann’s body was in a far corner by a chimney-stack, wearing a black dress and the stiletto heels she always wore. Beside her lay an empty bottle of Moet et Chandon champagne and a china mug lined with the sediment of the massive dose of tranquillisers and painkillers that had caused her death.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The police took away her diaries, and from these it was clear the taking of her life was no spur-of-the-moment decision.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Six months earlier, she had made a will and put all her affairs in order, but those who knew her were sure that nothing in her relationship with Tony — who had always been supportive of her — could have triggered her tragic end.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>At the inquest, notes from her diaries were read, revealing not only her tangled love life but also her deep feelings for Snowdon.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The Press had a field day. On holiday in India, Lucy picked up an English newspaper to learn that her husband had had a mistress for the whole of their married life — and before.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>It was a bombshell, and was deeply wounding for her. Nor, on her return home, did Tony, who hated discussions of this kind, give her any sort of explanation.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>But worse was to come. ‘Most people in Tony’s life don’t know what’s going on in other areas,’ one of his assistants once told me. ‘He is brilliant at keeping a lot of balls in the air at once — but sometimes, they all crash. And then there’s massive fallout.’</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>It was about to be one of those moments. Tony attended a party at the Wallace Collection museum in London to mark the centenary of Country Life magazine. Its features editor was a young woman by the name of Melanie Cable-Alexander.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Tony spotted her across the room and asked the man he was talking to if he knew her. ‘Yes,’ he replied, ‘cracking girl, isn’t she?’ and introduced them.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Melanie, daughter of a baronet, was stylish, intelligent, attractive and 33 — the same age as Tony’s daughter, Sarah.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Country Life had invited various eminent people to guest edit one of its weekly issues, and Tony, with his knowledge of photography, was a natural choice. Melanie was delegated to work alongside him.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>She felt an immediate sense of rapport with this good-looking, older man sparkling with ideas and fun. As she lived only a few minutes’ walk from Launceston Place, it was convenient for her to drop by on the way to work if there was anything that needed discussing.</p><img id=i-2b43d830c894fc40 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/01/19/01/005D163D00000258-4134246-Melanie_pictured_with_her_son_Jasper_daughter_of_a_baronet_was_s-a-82_1484787892693.jpg height=951 width=634 alt="Melanie (pictured with her son Jasper), daughter of a baronet, was stylish, intelligent, attractive and 33 — the same age as Tony’s daughter, Sarah" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>Melanie (pictured with her son Jasper), daughter of a baronet, was stylish, intelligent, attractive and 33 — the same age as Tony’s daughter, Sarah</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>He called her ‘Darling Melanie’, but the idea of an affair never entered her head: he was twice her age and married.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>He invited her to Old House, his West Sussex retreat, and she had a pleasant lunch with Tony, Lucy and their daughter, Frances. But the next time he asked her there, they were alone and he made it clear how attracted to her he was.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>A serious affair started, largely conducted at Old House, where friends treated them as a couple.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Melanie soon fell deeply in love, but it was a shock for her to discover she was pregnant. It was ‘a mistake’, she said later. She would be bitterly hurt by suggestions from some of Tony’s friends that she had tried to trap him into marriage.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Nervously, she broke the news to Tony, uncertain of what his reaction would be. He said it was entirely her decision as to whether or not she had the baby; if she decided to, he would stand by her.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>She didn’t know what to do.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>She was pregnant by someone extremely well known but who, to preserve his marriage, insisted on secrecy. What would be the effect on a child growing up with a father who could not be acknowledged?</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>She had no real home and not much money. Could she work and look after a child on her own? She tried discussing all this with Tony, but it was the sort of conversation he simply would not have.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Eventually, she decided that the opportunity to have a child by someone she loved overrode all other considerations. She would go ahead and accept the consequences.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>As her pregnancy became obvious, one of her visits to Launceston Place prompted Lucy to ask Tony who the father was. ‘I think she had a one-night stand,’ he told her.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Lucy, who after the Ann Hills affair had realised just how practised her husband was at concealing the truth, was not convinced.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>For her part, Melanie had told him he should tell Lucy the truth. If he wanted his marriage to work, as he said he did, he should face square-on what was happening.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>After DNA tests requested by Tony proved incontrovertibly that the baby was his, he telephoned Melanie, and, instead of talking himself, put Lucy on the phone. She asked if the child Melanie was carrying was Tony’s.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘I’m afraid it is,’ replied Melanie. ‘Thank you very much,’ said Lucy. ‘I just wanted to know the truth.’</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Lucy’s love for Tony had been wholehearted and she had vowed never to leave him. But she felt utterly betrayed, and so she moved out of Launceston Place.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Two weeks later, on April 30, 1998, Melanie’s son Jasper was born. Tony’s name was not on the birth certificate, and his involvement was not yet suspected. But gradually rumours began to spread and soon the story was out.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>With Lucy gone, Melanie and Tony could see each other more easily, and they did so. For Tony, sex, as always, was a motivating force. But at the same time, he was desperately trying to patch up his marriage. He could not, however, bring himself to do the one thing Lucy wanted — discuss his behaviour truthfully.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Melanie came round when she could, but most of her time was occupied by her job and her growing child. For the first time in years, Tony, who hated being on his own, spent much of his time alone. He seemed low and depressed.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>His lifeline was his work, but even here there were disappointments.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>In early 1997, not long before the death of Diana, Princess of Wales, he had taken the catalogue pictures of her for a charity sale of her dresses — only for them to be judged too formal alongside the fresher, livelier pictures taken by the new star photographer, Mario Testino, whose pictures received all the media attention. It felt like a snub for Snowdon.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Meanwhile, Melanie was struggling for money. She had no home of her own and was living with a small child in one room of a friend’s house. There were confrontations over how much support Tony should provide.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>She had refused newspaper offers to tell her story, but, to finance a house, Tony asked her to accept a lucrative offer from Hello!</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>She was unhappy at the idea, but consented. It raised £250,000, which paid for half a flat in Kensington. Tony stumped up the rest.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>As their affair continued, Melanie found its drawbacks were beginning to outweigh the positive aspects. Tony was controlling and over-possessive. And he was too demanding sexually, with a libido higher than men half his age.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>He also disliked a two-year-old claiming most of its mother’s attention. He was used to having everything around him arranged in its special place, and to have a tiny child roaming free was like having a tiger in his home.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The affair began to crumble as Melanie realised there was no future with Tony. Meanwhile, Tony’s hopes of a reconciliation with Lucy were dashed when she filed for divorce and was granted one. Yet neither she nor Tony pushed for their decree nisi to be made absolute.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>This gave Tony a faint glimmer of hope that he might still win her back. From then on, if a newspaper referred to him as being divorced, he would write to point out that, actually, he was still married.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>But although both Lucy and Melanie had departed, he was not alone for long.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Old girlfriends came to lunch; girls were occasionally spotted under the duvet by his housekeeper when she went to make his bed.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>And a new, regular appeared — brigadier’s daughter Emmy Hirst, an elegant and beautiful blonde.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>She was a friend from way back and when he moved the relationship up a gear, it seemed perfectly natural to both of them.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>By now, Tony — champion of the disabled who had used money from his divorce settlement from Princess Margaret to establish the Snowdon Award Scheme to give grants to handicapped students — was disabled himself. The effects of his childhood polio had returned, causing muscular atrophy.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>From limping badly and using a stick, he now needed a wheelchair. But no one ever heard the mildest word of complaint from him.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>For Emmy, it was sad seeing someone who had been so active now confined for most of the day to a swivel chair in front of his desk.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>He was still a big earner — his annual earnings were upwards of £250,000. But savings would have to be made. With a wife living separately, their daughter, and his son by another woman to support, the bills were piling up. With a heavy heart, he sold his beloved Old House in Sussex.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Then businesswoman Victoria Charlton, another old friend, came to work for him. Victoria found him new and lucrative clients among Russia’s billionaires.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>She took him on a photographic tour of India, which for him felt like a return to the golden days when he had flown all over the world on exciting commissions.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>They began an affair. For a long time, Emmy was unaware of it — but when she cottoned on, she left. She did not see why she should put up with infidelity from someone for whom she’d done so much.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘I’m into caring,’ she told him, ‘but not into sharing.’</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>However, what neither Emmy nor Victoria knew was that Tony had taken yet another of his old friends as a lover.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Marjorie Wallace, chief executive of Sane — the mental health charity she founded — had known Tony since she was a journalist accompanying him on photographic assignments at the Sunday Times back in the Seventies.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>They went out on the road together, working on stories about conditions in hospitals and mental homes. Many of these assignments fell to her because plenty of her colleagues found Tony difficult to work with. And Marjorie soon discovered why.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘He would insist on being incognito, so I would ring up the hotel and tell them to expect Miss Wallace and Mr Smith. Then we would arrive, and if they didn’t recognise him, his face was a study.’</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>In the car, he would always insist on having the window open, even when rain was coming in.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘Could we have the window up, Tony?’ Marjorie asked once, with water pouring down her shoulder. ‘But if I close it, how on earth will they recognise me?’ answered a surprised Tony.<span class=mol-style-bold>&nbsp;</span></p><ul class=mol-bullets-with-font><li class=mol-style-bold>ABRIDGED extract from Snowdon: The Biography, by Anne de Courcy (W&N, £9.99). © Anne de Courcy</li></ul><p class=mol-para-with-font><span class=mol-style-bold>For confidential support call the Samaritans on 116123, visit a local Samaritans branch, or click <a style=font-weight:700 rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>here&nbsp;</a></span><span class=mol-style-bold>for details.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pa3IpbCmmZmhe6S7ja6iaJ6Voq6quI6aqa2hk6GyboCQbGtrbGZkoK%2B71p2mp2WTnbatsIybnJqtpK56pa3UoJ%2BtnaJiwG6txp5loaydoQ%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./6573a01446163f76828b45e3-html.html><span>←</span><span>Resultados Lotera Nacional hoy viernes 8 de diciembre 2023: lista Sorteo Superior 2789</span></a>
