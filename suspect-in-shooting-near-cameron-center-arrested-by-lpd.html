Right now we only have one person that we have not arrested yet and that’s Buckley, all of the other shooters in the area have either turned themselves in or we were able to find and arrest them.”&nbsp;</span></p><figure class="photo layout-vertical hover-expand letterbox-style-default"><span class="expand hidden-print" data-toggle=modal data-photo-target=.photo-001367aa-6072-11ed-8f1a-e37d6c33772f data-instance=#gallery-items-e183ed0a-6071-11ed-94eb-7f984226a8d0-photo-modal data-target=#photo-carousel-e183ed0a-6071-11ed-94eb-7f984226a8d0><span class="fas tnt-expand"></span></span> <span class=caption-text><p>Ronald Buckley</p></span><span class=clearfix></span></figure><p><span>The LPD and other law enforcement agencies are still searching for 19-year-old Ronald Buckley, who is accused of shooting and killing two people in a car at Loper’s Laundry at 10th Street and 13th Avenue, just around the corner from the Cameron Center on 10th Avenue.</span></p><p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> <span>&nbsp; Pollock’s abandoned car was found at a convenience store on South 16th Avenue shortly after the shooting. He was thought to have a disagreement with an unidentified 20-year-old black man, who reportedly suffered a non-life-threatening gunshot wound to the hip and was transported by EMServ Ambulance to South Central Regional Medical Center for treatment. Investigators said that Pollock set up a meeting with the victim before shooting.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Police were told Pollock was living in the area around the Cameron Center and Daphne Park. After the shooting, Laurel School District officials stopped student walkers from leaving for about 30 minutes to make sure the area was safe.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Pollock was charged with aggravated assault, shoplifting, larceny and trespassing and booked into the Jones County Adult Detention Center.
