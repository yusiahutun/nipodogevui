This makes it much easier to communicate with partners and make agreeable compromises throughout the first half of the month.

You’ll also need to tap into what’s beneath the surface of your closest relationships, as the new moon on January 11 peaks in your intimate eighth house—and mental Mercury heads that way two days later. What have you learned about your closest bonds over the course of this retrograde? Now’s a time to set boundaries accordingly. Use the week ahead to tap into your intuition. Sometimes your gut feelings can be just as useful as hard facts.</p><p>January 20 is an exciting day, as Aquarius season begins lighting up your soul-expanding ninth house. Having the sun in a fellow air sign is awakening your thirst for knowledge and inspiring you to dream big. However, the full moon on January 25 reminds you that in order to manifest your most magical dream future, you’ll have to start by mapping out the details little by little.
