<span>Aldo Pusey</span></p><h1>Ron Whites Son Marshall White: His Career, Wife, &amp;amp; Other Facts</h1></header><section class=post-content><h3>Ron White, a stand-up comedian, actor, and author best known for being a founding member of the Blue Collar Comedy Tour, is the father of Marshall White.</h3><p>His stage name is Tater Salad, and he has performed on the Blue Collar Comedy Tour alongside Jeff Foxworthy, Bill Engvall, and Larry the Cable Guy.</p><p>Tater Salad, also referred to as Tater Salad, is Marshall’s father’s solo project. The movies Busted in Des Moines (1990), Drunk in Public (2003), They Call Me “Tater Salad” (2004), You Can’t Fix Stupid (2006), and Behavioral Problems (2009) all deal with behavioral issues.</p><p>Although in the past he frequently collaborated with his father, comedian Ron White, Marshall White is currently busier with his engagements.</p><p>Marshall states that while working with the Drunk In Public writer, he was exposed to many different aspects of the comedic industry. He additionally made sales for his father. Learn more about his current projects, his marital status, whether he has a girlfriend and other details.</p><p>Charles Don White and Barbara Joan Craig’s son, Ron White, was born on December 18, 1956, in Fritch, Texas. The Senior White was a member of the American Navy as well. Near the end of the Vietnam War, Marshall’s father, who enlisted in the military at the age of 17, served on the auxiliary rescue and Salvage ship USS Conserver.</p><p>From a young age, the Tater Salad comic wanted to be a comedian. Before moving back to the United States to pursue a comedy career, Ron briefly resided in Mexico and acquired a pottery factory there. Regarding Marshall’s mother, Lori Brice, who is currently Mrs. Exline, primarily participates in Facebook fundraising initiatives.</p><p>Nevertheless, Lori, Terry Exline’s current wife, has largely avoided media attention over the past ten years and has become something of a bygone name.</p><p>Marshall, the only child of Lori and Ron, attended Weddington High School and participated in the marching band there.</p><p>He also studied US history, environmental science, and music theory in high school. In his junior and senior years, he also enrolled in three AP classes.</p><p>Marshall, who is now in his 30s, claims to be skilled in several instruments and has mentored younger students when they were still in high school. In reality, he had been named Music Student of the Year while in school.</p><p>He is therefore skilled at music composition and arranging as an adult and is familiar with a variety of brass and woodwind instruments. He attended Full Sail University from 2009 to 2011 to earn a bachelor of science in recording arts after high school.</p><p>His areas of study included studio systems, acoustics, audio sweetening, music theory, audio production, and post-production. He also studied analog and digital studio practices. Marshall’s skills in analog or digital recording, editing, and mixing are listed on his LinkedIn profile.</p><p>He also has solid skills in basic soldering, studio/live recording instruction, and equipment maintenance and calibration. Additionally, Lori and Ron’s son have experience using multi-channel mixers for live sound reinforcement and recording.</p><p>He can also use professional software like Logic Pro, Garageband, and Pro Tools, with a focus on acoustic instruments. Marshall also received instruction in post-production, with a focus on both movies and video games. Additionally, he investigated Analog/Digital and Digital/Analog conversion under forest ecologist Brian Smithers.</p><h2>He Has An Equally Strong Work History</h2><p>Marshall White, White’s son, started working in the middle of the 2000s. During the summer of 2004, he was employed by Plastered Touring as a tour manager. He then worked as a cashier for Regal Cinemas from 2006 to 2007 in addition to being a floor employee for general cinema and Paly N Trade DRT Games.</p><p>As part of his doctoral degree, Marshall worked as a production assistant at Paramount Studios in the late 2000s. He worked as Michelle Wendt’s assistant while also learning the SMPTE time code during this period.</p><p>Marshall was a member of the advisory committee for The Marshall White Community Center, an Ogden City, Utah community recreation center, when he was reported in February 2021. The organization offers a wide range of community programs, workshops, activities, events, and resources at affordable prices.</p><p>According to the NAACP, it appears to be the only public structure in Utah that is named for a Black individual. It bears the name of deceased officer Marshall N. (Doc) White, the first African American law enforcement official to die in the line of duty in Utah. Marshall reportedly co-owns a smoke shop in Austin, Texas, as of late.</p><p>To live close to Marshall, his father Ron sold his Atlanta home during the summer of 2018 and purchased a high-rise in Austin. Ron said he had purchased a penthouse apartment on the 22nd floor with views of the Colorado River in downtown Austin, where his son Marshall was residing, when he announced his retirement from comedy in January 2022.</p><p>Also Read: <a class=waffle-rich-text-link href=#>Eniko Hart And Her Parents, Especially Her Mother, Are Very Close</a></p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>actor</a></span> <a href=#></a><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>Jack Mulhern</a></h3>Jack Mulhern is an American model and actor best known for his role in the Netflix thriller The Society as Grizz.
