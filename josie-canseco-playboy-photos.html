"My family name has a lot of talk behind it. I believe one of my biggest achievements to date is maintaining my career and image through all the chaos."</p><p>That career includes modeling gigs, an appearance in a <strong>Mike Stud</strong> music video and co-starring with her mother on the reality show, <strong>"The Mother-Daughter Experiment: Celebrity Edition."</strong></p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/b6/o/2016/05/25/b6ecac2b1add52c18cbbb32a730fa7c6_md.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit image-block__media-credit">Courtesy Playboy/Henrik Purienne</span><p>"I didn't learn anything surprising about myself, because I don't want to be a reality star," she says of her time on the Lifetime series. "I'm actually a weird, goofy and friendly person. Giving in to drama simply isn't me."</p><p>So ... what does she enjoy doing?</p><p>"After a week of going to castings, running errands and doing hour-long sessions at the gym, I like to come home, throw on my sweats and turn on 'Friends' or 'Family Guy,'" she admits. "In fact, if I had to pick one nonessential item to have in my earthquake emergency kit, a pair of my favorite sweatpants would definitely be it."</p><p>She's definitely not wearing sweats in this shoot though!</p><p>"I would love to own a dance studio for all ages where I can teach kids," Canseco adds of her future plans. "After all, seeing my own family happy and healthy is one thing that will always make me happy in return."</p><p>See more ... a lot more ... of Josie in the June issue of <strong><a href=#>Playboy</a></strong>, on newsstands now!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlfnd7j25ma21fn7y0tcRmmpqmo5qwsHnPpZiymp%2BuerG0zq2mrGc%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jerry-springer-cause-of-death-new-details-revealed.html><span>←</span><span>Jerry Springer's close friend reveals new details of his sudden death at 79</span></a>
