This is the best I can do.'</p><p>But far from holding her back, her firm decision led to her career blossoming soon afterwards.<br></p><p>She added: ‘Shortly after, I got Calvin Klein commercials and a movie, so it didn’t stop me!'</p><p>The actress continued on to model for Vogue magazine and designers like Yves Saint Laurent, Giorgio Armani, Anne Klein and Bill Blass before finding fame in Hollywood with films such as Green Card and Groundhog day.<br></p><p>Now a comfortable 9st 11lbs, mother-of-three Andie insists she is still happy with her weight.</p><p>She told U.S. health magazine Prevention: 'I feel pretty good about it. Also, as you get older, your face starts to look drawn. That’s why I think I’m better off with those extra five pounds.'</p><p>But there is one guilty pleasure Andie admits she couldn't live without - chocolate.</p><p>She explained: 'Well, it's not a guilty thing - I really do think that chocolate is good for you.<br></p><p>‘And it's better to eat that than not to have anything. That's when you end up eating too much - when you feel deprived.’&nbsp;</p><p>However, Andie says one of the ways she maintains a healthy outlook on life is to not compare herself to the person she was 25 years ago.</p><p>She said: 'My perspective has changed so much. Sure, I want to be attractive, but it's not my top priority.<br></p><p>'My mother died at 53 from a heart attack. I'm very close to that age. I want to be healthy for me, to be here for my kids and I want to enjoy my life.&nbsp; It's almost a relief to be able to think about yourself like that.<br></p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2009/05/27/article-1186729-03500257000005DC-623_468x566.jpg alt="Andie MacDowell" width=468 height=566 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p style=text-align:left class=imageCaption>The actress and mother-of-three insists she is now happy with her life and her weight<br></p><p>‘It's really about: "Do I feel healthy because I'm strong? Are my shoulders back? Can I be happy?&nbsp; And can I climb mountains?" Because you know, I really want to climb mountains.'</p><p>But instead of climbing mountains, Andie is currently sticking with hiking and has recently joined a local club in her hometown of North Carolina.</p><p>She said: ‘I love to hike, and my sister - we're 18 months apart, she's 53 and I'm 52 on April 21 -&nbsp; just joined a hiking club.'</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pa3IpbCmmZmhe6S7ja6iaKymqLWww8GisWiZoqm2pLjEZmhrbmNqfnp7oKebop1dgq6kkM6wnKWkXam8rbCMqK2eqqeatqi002auqKqbnruoecyom56kXp3Brrg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./amanda-pacheco.html><span>←</span><span>Amanda Pacheco Bio, Age, Height, Boyfriend, Net Worth</span></a>
