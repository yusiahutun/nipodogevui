You’re more than just an empath, babe! You’re likely one of the </span><span><a href=#>most emotional zodiac signs</a>.</span></p><p><span>One of the most frustrating parts about being an emotional sign is that you always want to fix </span><span>everything </span><span>(and </span><span>everyone</span><span>). Sound familiar? As emotional people, we often push aside our own needs to care for the needs of others. But if you do that for too long, you’ll end up burnt out and unable to take care of anyone at all! Learning to form energetic boundaries for yourself when you’re around frustrating people and large groups is essential</span>—trust me, <span>you’ll be grateful for them in the long run.</span></p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/askawitch_question3.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/newmoonintauruszodiac.gif?w=960&h=540&crop=1"><p><span>Having big emotions and being receptive to the feelings of others can definitely be an annoyance, especially when you’re forced to feel someone else’s <a href=#>bad attitude</a>, since emotional people can often mistake other people’s feelings for their own. But these same emotions can also be a source of great wisdom and inspiration for art! Many of the world’s greatest poets, painters and authors are some of the most emotional <a href=# id=auto-tag_zodiac-signs data-tag=zodiac-signs>zodiac signs</a> listed below.</span></p><p><span>With practice, you can channel your intense emotions to be used for good. Sensitivity is a superpower; you just need to learn how to harness it. Understanding that the stars have something to say about the matter is a great first step.</span></p><p><span>Below, I’ve picked out the three most emotional signs in the zodiac. And no</span>—<span>it’s not just the water signs!</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/cancer.jpg><h2><span>Cancer</span></h2><p><span>Cancers are THE most emotional sign in the zodiac—and we’re a unique combination of sensitive and strong. As a late-June baby myself, I’m definitely biased, but it’s true! What’s cool about our brand of emotional intelligence is that we’re empathetic and understanding, but simultaneously powerful.</span></p><p><span>Even though Cancers are classic water signs (all feels, all the time) and get mistaken for big softies, we’re </span><i><span>crabs</span></i><span>, remember? And crabs have thick, strong shells that keep them protected, even in the roughest waves.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/pisces.jpg><h2><span>Pisces</span></h2><p><span>Pisces, your emotions are </span><i><span>everything</span></i><span> to you. They’re how you get along in the world! Some people (like Virgos and Sags) put up defensive walls around themselves</span>—<span>they don’t want to let the world feel their emotions. You, on the other hand? You put your feelings waaaay out there and soak up all the emotions of the world around you, too, sometimes to your own detriment. Just make sure to protect your energy from people who don’t have your best intentions in mind.</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/leo.jpg><h2><span>Leo</span></h2><p><span>Leo, you’re the underdog on this list. Fire signs get a bad rap for being impulsive and overbearing. Thought I won’t deny that, you’re also emotional as hell. With your fixed fiery nature, you tend to get yourself in trouble, but if channeled properly, your emotions can be used for the greater good. Team up with these two other signs and you’ll be a soul-shifting, world-changing dream team.</span></p><p><a href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/banner-newsletter_july2020.jpg alt="StyleCaster newsletter" width=670 height=315 sizes="(max-width: 670px) 100vw, 670px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57y6Kdnqukrrmme8uorZ5lo5rFcH2QcmxubmFkx7CwyJqaZquZnLu0ecyoqq1llaK8tbXOp5ilZw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./rachel-bilson-shows-swimsuit-body-plunging-backless-one-piece-hawaii-html.html><span>←</span><span>Rachel Bilson shows off her swimsuit body in plunging backless one-piece in Hawaii</span></a>
