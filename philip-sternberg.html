Source: Instagram</p><p>The lovers first met each other when Catherine went to pick up the paycheque for her friend after an audition.</p><p>Catherine was dressed ridiculously – in short shorts, with two braids. It was actually for a role that Catherine was wrong for and didn’t get.</p><p>He then handed her the cheque and there was clear electricity between the two.</p><p>Although they didn’t exchange numbers, they knew that something was happening. Three months later, Catherine and he ran into each other at an event.</p><p>There, he told Catherine there was no way she was walking out of his life again. Later, they went to the cast and crew screening of Knocked Up together.</p><p>Both he and Catherine moved faster than either of them had ever experienced in previous relationships. The couple was already saying “I love you” within the first month and were engaged for six months.</p><h2><span id=The_Proposal>The Proposal</span></h2><p>Catherine recalls that Philip Sternberg’s proposal to her was very well-planned. The couple was driving down to San Diego from L.A. for the weekend. Catherine was starving and in a terrible mood for the entire drive.</p><p>She begged him to stop for fast food, but he said he had something planned. Then when they arrived, he pulled a picnic out. It was all of Catherine’s favorite cheeses and cured meats.</p><p>When she started eating, he asked her to take a walk with him. Although crushed, Catherine took that walk with him.</p><p>As they approached a cliff, he asked Catherine to walk over the fencing onto the cliff’s edge. Catherine thought that this man was either going to propose to or murder her.</p><p>She took the risk despite her thoughts and sat on a nearby beach. Although it was hard to see through the storm, she could see in the sand, he had written out “Will You Marry Me?”.</p><p>He wrote it in painted white seashells and long-stemmed roses.</p><p>He then dropped to his knee, and Catherine took the crappy flea market ring off her ring finger and threw it into the sea. Catherine says that saying yes to him was the smartest move she has ever made.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-88785 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/fresherpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Philip-Sternberg-posing-for-a-photo-with-his-wife-before-their-date.jpg alt="Philip Sternberg" width=650 height=703 data-sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-88785 class=wp-caption-text>Philip Sternberg posing for a photo with his wife before their date.
