These properties make it an excellent material for use in kinetic energy weapons that kill with velocity and mass.</p><img data-qa=BaseImage-handleRenderImage-StyledImage src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/wide_landscape/public/d8/video/thumbnail/2023/07/10/Thumbnail-CLEAN_0.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p data-qa=SCMPYoutubeVideoPreview-PreviewDuration class="css-dkee4u eaw92su1">01:37</p><p data-qa=SCMPYoutubeVideoPreview-PreviewTitle class="css-1ajvbe4 eaw92su2">North Korea accuses Japan of bribing UN nuclear watchdog to approve Fukushima water discharge</p><p>North Korea accuses Japan of bribing UN nuclear watchdog to approve Fukushima water discharge</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">When a tungsten rod projectile hits a military concrete target at an extremely high speed, it generates a high-pressure shock wave that compresses and heats the target material to very high temperatures and pressures. This causes the target to transition from a solid to a plasma state, where the electrons are stripped from the atoms and the material becomes ionised, according to Fu’s team.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The plasma state of the target material is highly conductive to electrical currents generated by the high-pressure shock wave. These electrical currents can then create a magnetic field that interacts with the plasma, generating a force that accelerates the plasma to even higher velocities.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">This accelerated plasma forms a plasma jet that erodes the target material and contributes to the penetration process. However, the plasma jet also interacts with the tungsten rod, causing it to erode due to the high-temperature and high-pressure conditions, according to the experiment.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The remaining mass of the tungsten rod is reduced significantly during the process. At Mach 8, Fu’s team found an entire arms-length rod can vanish almost instantly after impact.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“It is very necessary to study the penetration of tungsten rods into concrete at hypersonic speeds,” Fu and his colleagues wrote in the paper.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“With the development of launch platform technology, the speed of rod-type projectiles is increasing. However, the destructive effects of tungsten rods against concrete vary between hypersonic and conventional speeds. The destructive mechanism also changes accordingly,” the paper said.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Chinese develop purest, strongest tungsten material for extreme uses</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“The penetration effect of kinetic energy projectiles on concrete has always been a research focus for a number of countries.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The university is closely linked to China’s space defence programme, according to openly available information.</p>During the Cold War, the <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">US Air Force</span></a> launched a research programme on kinetic bombardment known as Project Thor. The concept was originally developed by Boeing scientist Jerry Pournelle in 1957 and later refined by others, including the Rand Corporation in the 1960s.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The idea was to drop a 6 metre (19.7 feet) tungsten rod from orbit to strike targets on Earth – achieving the force of a nuclear weapon without the radioactive fallout.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In 2003, a United States Air Force report introduced a new system called Hypervelocity Rod Bundles (HRB). This system consisted of tungsten rods that were 6.1 metres long and 0.3 metres in diameter. These rods were intended to be launched from space using a conventional rocket or other launch system, and steered to their target using a variety of guidance systems.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The HRB has the ability to strike targets globally with speeds of around 3km per second at impact. By deploying six to eight satellites on a given orbit, the system could strike a target within 12-15 minutes, according to some calculations. That is less than half the time it takes for an ICBM to reach its target – and without the warning of a launch.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Some researchers said that a large “rod from God” could have the yield of a small tactical nuclear bomb, and they could also be effective against nuclear bunkers.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/wide_landscape/public/d8/video/thumbnail/2023/07/10/Thumbnail-CLEAN_0.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">But these systems were never implemented. One major reason was that the development and deployment of these weapons in space would have required a significant investment of time, money and resources, such as superheavy rockets.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Another factor was the development of other weapons systems, such as precision-guided munitions and cruise missiles, which were seen as more practical and effective for many military applications.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Then there would be political and strategic considerations. A misfire, for instance, could cause a disaster. The deployment of such a system could be seen as provocative or destabilising by other nations.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">But China has taken the US military blueprints seriously. In a paper published in 2018, Chinese scientists reported a prototype experiment involving a hypervelocity kinetic energy projectile hitting a ground target in the Gobi Desert.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In the unprecedented experiment, a 140kg (308lbs) tungsten rod was fired at a speed of 4.6km per second by a classified platform from high above the desert, resulting in a parabolic-shaped impact crater with a depth of 3 metres and a diameter of 4.6 metres. The tungsten rod had a diameter of 11cm (4.33 inches) and a length of 84cm. The target area was sand and gravel.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">It is possible that this experiment was intended to simulate the effects of a Project Thor or HRB-type weapon, according to some researchers, as the tungsten rod used in the experiment was similar in composition to those proposed for such systems.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">But the Gobi experiment raised some questions about the effectiveness of the weapon when being used against a target hidden under the desert.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Beijing can’t make North Korea ‘denuclearise’, Mr Blinken</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The data collected by Chinese scientists from the site suggested that the hypervelocity impact cratering effect was similar to that of a shallow-buried underground explosion, and that as the velocity increases, the effect becomes more like that of a surface-contact explosion.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">This means that a “rod from God” could have limited ground-penetrating capabilities.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The natural ground in the Gobi Desert is different from reinforced concrete bunkers, which are typically designed to withstand high-velocity impacts and other forms of damage.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In its study, Fu’s team investigated how the depth of penetration of tungsten rods into concrete targets changed with the velocity of the projectile.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The results showed that depth initially increased with the velocity of the projectile, but then decreased after reaching a certain point.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“There is a maximum penetration depth of about 80 times that of the projectile diameter at the speed of 1.2km per second [about 3.5 times the speed of sound],” Fu’s team said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Pushing the speed higher to hypersonic range, or above Mach 5, would not help the tungsten rod go any deeper into the concrete.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“The penetration depth under ultra-high speed conditions has no advantages over medium and low-speed penetration,” the team said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">At Mach 8, for instance, the entire rod would be turned into a plasma jet on impact, and the jet could only result in a penetration depth of about 50 times that of the rod diameter.</p><img data-qa=BaseImage-handleRenderImage-StyledImage

data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">But that is just one of the factors to take into consideration when measuring the destructive power of a kinetic energy weapon such as a tungsten rod.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Other factors include the kinetic energy of the projectile, the velocity of the projectile, the mass of the projectile and the material properties of the target.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Surface explosions can also cause a wide range of damage, including structural damage to buildings and other infrastructure, injuries and fatalities to people and animals, and environmental damage.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Some military scientists say that the development of new launch technologies, such as hypersonic vehicles and rail guns, could increase the potential application of tungsten rods as a kinetic energy weapon.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Rail guns use electromagnetic forces to accelerate projectiles to extremely high velocities and hit targets 200km away at Mach 7.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Meanwhile hypersonic missiles, which can travel at speeds of Mach 5 or higher, provide another possible platform for tungsten rods to be launched from near-space altitudes.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">China is the world’s largest producer of tungsten, accounting for over 80 per cent of global production. The second largest producer is Russia.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The United States is a significant consumer of tungsten, but it is not a major producer. The US military is heavily dependent on imports to meet its tungsten needs, with most of its supply coming from China.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51ku6bD0miaoaGelny0r8iepZydX5a%2FtbXCpZxoa2JnhnqFj2iaoaGelsButNipnKurn6O2pHnTrqWgq6Sau26%2Bzp1knrCgmr%2BqucSnq2abmJa5rbHNoJysZaWoerO7w6xkoKeUYsCxrcKeZLCdkaW8r3nCqKWcnaCp</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./stormy-daniels-shares-make-free-selfie-instagram-html.html><span>←</span><span>Stormy Daniels shares make-up-free selfie on Instagram</span></a>
