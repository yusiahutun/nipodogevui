He said there’d been an explosion, and he was going to check it out.'<br></span></p><p><span>That explosion was the first hijacked plane, American Airlines Flight 11, crashing into the North Tower at 8.46am, and the beginning of the worst terrorist attacks in modern history.<br></span></p><p><span>Frantically, Mary tried to call back, but Pat didn’t answer. Confused, she flicked on the television, and as the dialling tone played in her ear, she watched United Airlines Flight 175 crash into the South Tower between the 77th and 85th floors.</span></p><h2>RELATED ARTICLES</h2><ul class="rotator-pages link-xocc"><li class=rotator-prev><a href=# data-page=prev>Previous</a></li><li><a href=# data-page=1>1</a></li><li class=rotator-next><a href=# data-page=next>Next</a></li></ul><ul class="rotator-panels link-bogr1 linkro-ccox"><li><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2011/09/09/article-2035558-0DC5AEEF00000578-542_87x84.jpg width=62 height=60 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto> <span>'I'm not saying I want to forget.

I knew my husband was in that building. I was in shock and denial. All I could think was, "Is this all real?"' The last time Mary spoke to her beloved husband, there was no time for a final goodbye, no chance for 'I love you.'<br></span></p><p><span>'But we weren’t like that, anyway,' says Mary. 'I always knew he loved me and the girls. He didn’t have to tell me.'<br></span></p><p><span>Fifty-six minutes later, the South Tower collapsed in a plume of pulverized concrete and burning debris, killing approximately 900 innocent people, including Mary’s husband.</span><br></p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2011/09/09/article-2035599-0DCC0E3500000578-279_634x413.jpg height=413 width=634 alt="'So depressed': Mary said she felt incredibly lonely giving birth to Grace without her husband there" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>'So depressed': Mary said she felt incredibly lonely giving birth to Grace without her husband there</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2011/09/09/article-2035599-0DCBF14800000578-877_634x408.jpg height=408 width=634 alt="Together: Mary with her late husband Patrick and two of their children, Katie and Alison" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>Together: Mary with her late husband Patrick and two of their children, Katie and Alison</p><p><span>Car enthusiast Patrick, 35, and Mary, 33, were an adventurous young couple that often took weekend motorcycle trips around picturesque New England. 'He had a need for speed,' smiles Mary. 'He used to wake up at 5am to workout and go for a ride in his Porsche.<br></span></p><p><span>'But Patrick always put his family first – he once turned down his dream car to surprise me with mine. One day, he called me to say he had to work late, but to check out front for a package. When I looked outside, there he was pulling in with a brand new BMW, my dream car for me and the kids, with a big bow on it.'<br></span></p><span><span style=color:red>'I was so depressed at the birth, with him not being there.

'He didn’t miss a single doctor’s appointment – and was there for every late night ice cream craving. Patrick and I were so excited to be having a third child, and as the baby grew bigger we enjoyed discussing baby names.<br></span></p><p><span>'He was hesitant about 'Grace', but when I told him she was the patron saint of motorcyclists, that was it, he was convinced.'<br></span></p><p><span>As September began, Mary and Patrick busied themselves preparing for labour, unaware that Patrick would never live to see his daughter, Grace, born.<br></span></p><p><span>'I was so depressed at the birth, with him not being there,' says Mary. 'Some people would've called it quits, but I could never do that to my kids.'<br></span></p><p><span>Exactly one month after the tragedy and just a week after she held Patrick's memorial service, Mary gave birth to baby Grace.<br></span></p><p><span>'It was the first step that I had to move forward without him,' admits Mary. 'It was my kids who kept me going. As horrible as my life was going to be, I imagined what my kids' would be like if I wasn't here for them.'</span><br></p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2011/09/09/article-2035599-0DC77E9100000578-802_634x352.jpg height=352 width=634 alt="Handpicked: Mary said her new husband Andy Semel had been handpicked by Patrick.

'My whole identity had been stolen,' she confessed. 'I wasn't fit for society. I'd hear people complain about gas prices going up and I just wanted to scream out to the world: "You have no idea what a problem is!"'<br></span></p><p><span>Then in February of 2002, Mary says she got a small bit of closure. 'The New York Office of the Chief Medical Examiner called to say they had finally found a piece of Patrick's remains,' she recalls.<br></span></p><p><span>They had identified a fragment of his sternum, and asked Mary if she would like it. 'At least it was something,' she says. Something, indeed, as more than half of the families of the 2,749 victims have yet to receive any remains of their loved ones.<br></span></p><span><span style=font-weight:700>'</span></span><span>I didn’t even know there were jumpers for a long time. When I saw the pictures, I got out my magnifying glass to see if any were Patrick'</span><span></span><p><span>In the wake of 9/11, Mary's community rallied around her young family. 'They cooked us dinner for months and months,' said Mary. 'They had a schedule.'<br></span></p><p><span>Gifts poured in from neighbours and friends. College funds were set-up for the kids, quilts were knitted for baby Grace, and one of Patrick's clients even paid for a nanny for a full year.<br></span></p><p><span>'They say it takes a village to raise a family,' said Mary. 'It really did for us.'<br></span></p><p><span>But consumed by grief, Mary was often inconsolable in front of her children. 'Then one day at dinner, my daughter Alison asked: "When are you ever going to stop crying Mom?" That's when it hit me,' says Mary.<br></span></p><p><span>'I realised the terrorists may have taken Patrick, but I still had control of me. I couldn’t let them win.'<br></span></p><p><span>Today, the family's beautiful house is in the well to-do town of Yorktown Heights, where her neighbours include Bill Clinton, and the house is a hive of activity.</span><br></p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2011/09/09/article-2035599-0DCBABF400000578-22_634x580.jpg height=580 width=634 alt="Comfort blanket: Grace, 9, still sleeps every night clutching one of 'Daddy Patrick's' old cycling jerseys" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>Comfort blanket: Grace, 9, still sleeps every night clutching one of 'Daddy Patrick's' old cycling jerseys</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2011/09/09/article-2035599-0049E46600000258-415_634x918.jpg height=918 width=634 alt="World Trade Center: Patrick Danahy worked on the 90th floor of the South Tower as Vice President of Fiduciary Trust.

'My girls have never seen the footage,' Mary says, as the music echoes around the room.<br></span></p><p><span>'In fact, I hadn’t seen the towers collapse in their entirety until recently. It made me so depressed. I didn’t even know there were jumpers for a long time. When I saw the pictures, I got out my magnifying glass to see if any were Patrick.'<br></span></p><p><span>But Mary knew she had to move on, and one church Sunday in February 2004, she met Andy Sammel. 'I never even thought about meeting someone new,' says Mary. 'But then he came along and was so much help.<br></span></p><p><span>'He was the one who asked us out - and I mean us – he asked the girls too.'<br></span></p><p><span>In 2005, Mary married Andy, who she says was 'handpicked' by Patrick. 'The girls call him Dad.'<br></span></p><span>'I never really think of my new father as a stepdad. I just think of him as my regular ad, but I don't forget Daddy Patrick'</span><p><span>Today, Grace still sleeps every night clutching one of 'Daddy Patrick's' old cycling jerseys. 'I never really think of my new father as a stepdad,' says Grace. 'I just think of him as my regular dad, but I don’t forget Daddy Patrick.'<br></span></p><p><span>A year after Mary remarried, her recovery was thrown a different obstacle. In August of 2006, she was diagnosed with breast cancer and given an 80 per cent chance to live for another 10 years.<br></span></p><p><span>'I remember one of the girls said to me: "Mummy, if you go, who's going to tell us when we talked and when we walked?" I was so worried for them.'<br></span></p><p><span>Thankfully, Mary, 43, beat cancer after four months of intensive treatment, and today, she, Andy, 47, Alison, 13, Katie, 12, and Grace, nine, are a happy family once again.<br></span></p><p><span>'I'm blessed,' says Mary. 'I have three healthy kids and a great new husband who respects the family I couldn’t have and the family we are now.'<br></span></p><p><span>Mary says the family will go to church on the 10th anniversary of 9/11, but will remain out of the public eye.<br></span></p><p><span>'I relive 9/11 everyday,' she says. 'And I can feel when the day is getting closer. When the summer starts to come to an end and the autumn chill enters the air. I get moody and dark.<br></span></p><p><span>'I start to think of all the things Patrick and I did in the weeks before 9/11. But ten years on, I'm more peaceful. I don't have to deal with as much sadness and grief and guilt.'<br></span></p><p><span>But as the years wear on and the children grow older, Mary says they've started to ask more questions.<br></span></p><p><span>'They've started asking me: 'What was Daddy really like?' It's like I'm reviving Patrick every time I tell them more about him. And every time I'm colouring in the picture they have of their Father.'</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pa3IpbCmmZmhe6S7ja6iaKaVrMBwrdGtoJyklWJ%2FcX%2BUbnByZ4edsq95xqigp59dqMGwvIycqbKhnpx6jrvMZo6inJ%2Bseq270q1koa2jl66vsIxyZGppXZbBta3CpKpmpZ%2Bjwam%2FjKmpnp%2Belru1edOeo6WrXajBsL7YZ5%2BtpZw%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./meet-the-great-pottery-throw-down-2020-cast-on-instagram-flea-rosa-and-ronaldo.html><span>←</span><span> Meet The Great Pottery Throw Down 2020 cast on Instagram Flea, Rosa and Ronaldo!
