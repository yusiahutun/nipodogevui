However, despite the hardships, Melanie Scrofano didn’t hesitate to complete her commitments and finished filming the show, ‘Wynonna Earp’ while she was pregnant with second child. Her child was born four days after the show got officially wrapped up. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-172 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2 style=text-align:justify>Won the 'Girls on Top'!</h2><p style=text-align:justify>Melanie started her modeling career at the age of thirteen. However, she isn’t only focused on modeling but often appears in television shows and movies as well. She recently won a hit show&nbsp;‘Girl on Top’&nbsp;with significant&nbsp;votes while competing with the final contestant Alycia Debnam Carey. She thanked her fans for voting her on the show despite the pregnancy days in one of her recent tweets.</p><p style=text-align:justify><img alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wikinetworth.com/uploads/Melanie%20Scrofano%20tweet.PNG ezimgfmt="rs rscb2 src ng ngcb2" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h2 style=text-align:justify>Her Acting Roles:</h2><p style=text-align:justify>Besides modeling and appearing in the favorite Cosmopolitan magazine, Melanie has tried her hand out in the acting field also. She has portrayed significant characters in some of the hit&nbsp;movies including Saw VI (2009), Robocop (2014). She has successfully wrapped her shooting part of the show ‘Wynonna Earp’ which is on the third season now. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-184 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2 style=text-align:justify>How much is Melanie's Net worth?</h2><p style=text-align:justify>There is very less information about the earnings of Melanie.

In an interview with Calgary Herald, the actress discussed how supportive her entire crew had become during the shooting period. She said, <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p style=text-align:justify>“None of my friends knew. Even family members didn’t really know because you just couldn’t risk something leaking online. So it was a bit lonely. It’s a hard time in your life, to begin with, and then you can’t talk with your support systems, which really sucks. But the Wynonna Earp cast and crew has become like a family. So I had great support there. ”</p><p style=text-align:justify>The makers were also delighted to shoot her role with a unique dress that was made to hide her baby bump. Eventually, her second child as a son was born on April 18, 2017, right after&nbsp;four days&nbsp;where the season 2 of ‘Wynonna Earp’ got wrapped.</p><h2 style=text-align:justify>Sharing a Beautiful Married Life!</h2><p style=text-align:justify>Melanie is happily married to husband,&nbsp;Jeff with whom she shares two adorable children. Her family doesn’t appear much in the limelight, but they are very much visible in her social media posts.&nbsp;</p><p style=text-align:justify><img alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wikinetworth.com/uploads/Melanie%20Scrofano%20with%20her%20family.PNG style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto ezimgfmt="rs rscb2 src ng ngcb2"><br>Caption: Melanie Scrofano with her husband, Jeff and their two children, the photo posted on November 13, 2107.<br>Source: Instagram <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-174 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p style=text-align:justify>No doubt Melanie has a small and happy family who are of paramount to each other.
