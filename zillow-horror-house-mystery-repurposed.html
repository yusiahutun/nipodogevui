There is a master bedroom in the house that's covered with a Pittsburgh Steelers bed set, as well as a part of a basement with chairs a stage with a pole set up in the middle.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>There also appears to be an auditorium type seating area with bench-staggered seating made out of unstained boards of wood coated with carpet that face a small projector screen hanging from a wall.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Perhaps the gnarliest image from the house, however, is a small room that shows a stained, bare mattress pushed off into a corner of the room. The photo promoted one user to write: "why did they not just take the pictures empty... who said yes let's photograph a STAINED mattress."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>However, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Cincinnati Enquirer</a> looked into the property and wrote that it was owned by contractor Wayne Gheen Jr. who purchased laundromat that was purportedly in deep disrepair. He would go on to convert the building into a large home with a focus on partying.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Gheen says that he has a lot of friends, and upwards of 500 people would be in the home at any given time. He set up pool tables, a lounge area, DJ equipment, and a bar where people would come in to hang out. However, he started having trouble with authorities after he was accused of running a night club in the building, despite it being zoned as a single family home.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>The outlet quoted Gheen as saying: "Over the course of the parties, there was no crime, no drugs, no fights, just a bunch of friends. I know everyone, I got a lot of friends. People from the public tried to come too and the city came down hard on me. They said I couldn’t' do it … After I dumped $50,000 or $60,000 in the basement, they pretty much told me I can’t charge people at the door and let them drink."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Gheen said that upon selling the home he would consider purchasing "a bar with the proceeds."
