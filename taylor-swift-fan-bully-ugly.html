The songstress sent packages full of hand-picked goodies to fans at random, and in return, she asked that they upload a <a href=#>video</a> of their reactions. They obliged. Unfortunately, haters gonna hate, and one fan was the recipient.</p><p>When superfan Lucy Ashton uploaded her adorable video, she was met with a very cruel comment, reading: "UR UGLY TO BE COMPLETELY HONEST." It wasn't long before Swift herself saw the anonymous comment and, of course, she stepped in.</p><p>"NO, ANONYMOUS. NO," the singer writes in response to the Negative Nancy, later calling Ashton "the cutest human ever born," according to <a href=#>according to BuzzFeed</a>. BuzzFeed also chatted with the fan after the incident, and she was still in shock that Swift came to her rescue.</p><p>“I honestly was so shocked," Ashton says. "I didn’t even know that she was online. I responded to the message and it didn’t really faze me as much as the anonymous person had hoped, I guess. I logged off and a couple of minutes later, I came back on and saw that she had responded and stood up for me. I immediately started crying and contacted all of my friends that I had met through Taylor and Tumblr. There was definitely just a lot of crying and smiles that night. And fangirling with my friends."</p><p>Friends, including one of the biggest superstars on the planet.</p><p><strong>Who Is Taylor Swift, Anyway?</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskajBprvFnKaupqSnxm%2BvzqZmrZmpobyzedKwoJ%2BsXZuur3nBrqOlsV2qtK3Fjg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./6606ff7b46163f095b8b45db-html.html><span>←</span><span>Osasuna: Muchos pretendientes y nombres propios para el banquillo de Osasuna</span></a>
