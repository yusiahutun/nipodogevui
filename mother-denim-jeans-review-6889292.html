This is the question I was forced to ask myself while standing inside of a palatial dressing room at Saks Fifth Avenue’s flagship store in New York City, marveling at how perky my butt looked in a <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">pair of Mother Denim jeans</a>. The answer, for me? A cool $268.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">It had been awhile since I dropped major cash on a pair of designer jeans. For over a decade I refused to wear anything but a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Rag & Bone skinny jean</a>. However, earlier in the fall, I came to the realization that I needed a denim refresh. And whilst I adamantly refused to dive into the mom jeans look, I was finally ready to explore other options, but they had to meet a few requirements; they needed to be versatile enough to wear a few times a week, so comfortable that I wouldn’t want to peel them off immediately after a full day of wearing them, and, of course, flattering.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">When I first saw the Mother Denim’s <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Rider Skimp Jeans</a> on the rack, a cool, high-waisted straight-leg style, I knew they were the ones —&nbsp;and I was right.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Shop now:</strong> $248–$268 (Originally $268); <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">amazon.com</a> and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">nordstrom.com</a></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Admittedly, I’m a few years late to the Mother Denim game. <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Jennifer Garner</a>, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nocaes>Meghan Markle</a>, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>Olivia Wilde</a>, and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=4>Jennifer Lopez</a> are just a few of the celebrities responsible for the hype surrounding the Los Angeles-based brand — and a well-deserved hype, too. The high-waisted style I tried, which kept my tummy adequately tucked in, was surprisingly comfortable, offering more stretch than a pair of Lululemon leggings. The Rider jeans are made out of 98 percent cotton, which makes them incredibly soft and pliable. In terms of sizing, I opted for a size down, but it really depends how tight or loose you want to wear them.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">And while they flattered my figure similar to a pair of skinnies, they were loose enough in all the right places to be considered, well, cool. And, as I gazed at my reflection of the mirror, I felt overwhelmingly chicer than in my usual pair of jeans. An added bonus? The clever cut, which gently scoops the backside ever-so-slightly, gave my butt a much-needed boost.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Over the past month I have been wearing my Mother jeans on repeat and, honestly, I have zero regrets about splurging on them. In fact, I am considering investing in another style since I love them so much. <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Shop the brand at Amazon</a> or <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Nordstrom</a> and snag your own pair of Mother jeans.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_17-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Shop now:</strong> $218; <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">amazon.com</a> and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim" data-affiliate-link-rewriter="u1=${REQUEST_ID}-${DOC_ID}">nordstrom.com</a></p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_19-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_20-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Shop now:</strong> $238; <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">amazon.com</a> and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">nordstrom.com</a>&nbsp;</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_22-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_23-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Shop now:</strong> $228; <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">amazon.com</a> and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim" data-affiliate-link-rewriter="u1=${REQUEST_ID}-${DOC_ID}">nordstrom.com</a><br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57zKiroZ2iYrGmusimZKOdkaPAbr7Er6Cer11rhXmFkXJp</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./suspect-in-hit-and-run-involving-motorcyclist-truck-set-for-trial.html><span>←</span><span>Suspect in hit-and-run involving motorcyclist, truck set for trial</span></a>
