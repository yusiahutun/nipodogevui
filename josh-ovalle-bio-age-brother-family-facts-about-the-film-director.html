Ovalle is certainly one for the future, the young starlet has been attracting attention ever since his first film, and the audience has not stopped praising his good works.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Josh Ovalle Biography, Age</strong></h2><p>Josh Ovalle is an American filmmaker and Internet celebrity. He was born on April 21, 1998, in Seattle, Washington. Josh grew up in Seattle with his parents and his two siblings. Like normal children, he went to school, but he started doing things normal children didn’t do at a very young age by making movies.</p><p>His current career seems to have evolved around the fact that Josh is a filmmaker, but it wasn’t his hobby as a child. As a child, he liked to spend time in the kitchen baking various foods with his mother. At some point, one might have thought that he would consider a career path or even end up becoming either a baker or a cook or even both. But today we can see that life had other plans for him. However, we cannot rule out that Josh might one day own a restaurant or bakery.</p><p>When he started making movies, it surprised so many people around him, and people were amazed at how a teenager of about 13 years old possessed such talents and how he managed to use them at a very tender age. Josh shot Minimum Max, his first movie when he was only 13 years old. The film tells the story of a little boy who suffers from Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). Many believed that he made the film to express how he suffers from ADHD. Since Josh Ovalle began making films, he has gradually begun to overcome the disease.</p><p><strong>ALSO READ: <a href=#>Landon Clements Biography, Age, Net Worth, Ex-husband, Family</a></strong></p><p>When Maximum Max was released, it became viral and received over 500 thousand hits on YouTube and other online media platforms.
