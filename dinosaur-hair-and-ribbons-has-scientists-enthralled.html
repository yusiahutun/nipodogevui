This was not actual hair, an exclusively mammalian feature. Many dinosaurs had feathers. In fact, birds evolved from small feathered dinosaurs about 150 million years ago.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Likely from a distance it looked hairy rather than feathery,” Martill said. “Likely it had hairlike protofeathers over much of its body but they are only preserved along its neck, back and arms. The ones on its back are very long and give it a sort of mane that is unique for dinosaurs.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Ubirajara’s ribbonlike structures may have been used for display, possibly to attract mates or intimidate adversaries or in inter-male rivalry, Martill added.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Such displays often are made by male animals – think of a peacock’s elaborate tail feathers – leading Martill to make an “educated guess” that this Ubirajara individual was male.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Fossils reveal ‘cute’ dinosaur forerunner smaller than a cellphone</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“The ribbons that seem to come from the shoulders are like nothing I have seen in nature before,” Martill said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">While it is impossible to know from the fossil, Martill said Ubirajara may have been colourful.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I bet it was,” he added.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51ku6bD0miuqKqcmXyivtOimqWdX2h%2BcoCQaWtonJmjvLSt1KtkoZmZp3qiusNmqaKakqS7tHnHmqpmq5Oesq%2FAyKyrrGWVo8GpvsClo56c</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./king-charles-queen-camilla-lead-royals-easter-mattins-service-2024.html><span>←</span><span>Beaming King Charles and Queen Camilla lead royals at Easter Sunday service - best photos</span></a>
