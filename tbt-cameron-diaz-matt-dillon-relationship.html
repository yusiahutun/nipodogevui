As reported by <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Rolling Stone</a>, the two didn’t begin dating until January of 1996 (though at the time she played coy regarding the name of her “boyfriend,” who she noted was “in the business”).</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-why-we-loved-them></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Why We Loved Them</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>SGranitz/WireImage</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Gotta love love! Though Diaz and Dillon kept things low-key in the public eye, the few quotes the former did allow about her S.O. were endearing as hell. In ’97 Diaz told the British <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Guardian</a>, “I love him incredibly.” According to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>Rolling Stone</a>, the Charlie’s Angels star also once gushed about the actor’s work ethic: “Matty, he’s the best. He’s one of a kind … He’s never taken that commercial route. He’s an intelligent, poetic, full, real human being. And he’s down-to-earth. Matt is the greatest.” Quite the endorsement!</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The pair went on to work together on There’s Something About Mary. Co-star Lin Shaye described their sweet behavior on set in ‘98, telling <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>People</a>, “Matt would come over and rub her shoulders … if it had been a long day. I would notice them sitting on a bench together, or stretching out with her head on his chest. They were affectionate in a really gentle way.”</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-when-they-peaked></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_19-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>When They Peaked</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_20-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Magma Agency/WireImage</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_21-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">These two had the country club gala look down. The evening gown and shoulder-wrapped cardigan style didn’t really make its way into the 21st century, but that’s OK — it died a happy, sartorially fulfilled death right then and there. Has a photo ever better encapsulated 1997?</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-the-breakup></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_23-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>The Breakup</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_24-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Dave Benett/Getty Images</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_25-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Reports cite the end of Diaz and Dillon’s relationship in ’98, following the release of There’s Something About Mary. Dillon opened up about the relationship years later, telling <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Parade</a> in 2006, "I fell in love. It’s a very powerful thing when you feel that way about somebody. Cameron was a muse for me. I hadn't been in any deep emotional relationships.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_27-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">As for the split, he told <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Rolling Stone</a> it was a matter of geography (sort of), explaining, “Look, I loved her and we were very close, but it just ran its course. We’re both actors, she was living in L.A., and I was living in New York, and I didn’t want to commit to moving out there. But I don’t want to say it was about any of those things. It just ran its course.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_29-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Diaz has, for the most part, avoided commenting on her splits. When pressed by <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Andy Cohen</a> to discuss her dating history in 2016, Diaz said, “You know what? Nothing matters now that I have my husband. I don’t even remember any of that,” referring to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Benji Madden</a>, whom she wed in 2015. “No one compares. Everything else just washes and slips away. You realize, ‘Oh, right, this is what the real thing is. This is what real love is. This is what real commitment and devotion is.’”</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-where-they-are-now></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_33-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Where They Are Now</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_34-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Diaz hasn’t starred in a film since 2014</a>, a decision she described as giving her “peace in my soul.” However, after embracing motherhood and entrepreneurship — she welcomed <a href=# class=pseudoStyle data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>daughter Raddix</a> in late 2019, as well as started her own wine brand, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>Avaline</a>, with business partner, Katherine Power — Diaz is ready to get back in the Hollywood saddle. She will be co-starring in the Netflix action-comedy Back in Action alongside Jamie Foxx.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_38-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Dillon has reportedly been dating Italian actress Roberta Mastromichele since 2014.
