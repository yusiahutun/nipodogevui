More than 70 million Americans have a criminal record that creates significant barriers to employment, economic stability, and successful reentry into society, the release says.</p><p>According to the release, thousands of legal and regulatory restrictions prevent these individuals from accessing employment, housing, voting, education, business licensing, and other basic opportunities. Because of these barriers, nearly 75 percent of people who were formerly incarcerated are still unemployed a year after being released.</p><p>Safer Foundation provides services designed exclusively for people with criminal records. Its vision is equal employment opportunities for people impacted by the criminal legal system thereby improving the socio-economic well-being of the individual, their family, and the community. In addition to its Safer Sacks fundraiser during Second Chance Month.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Reentry Simulation</strong> <strong>event set</strong></h3><p>Safer Foundation will raise awareness of the need to give second chances to deserving community members by hosting a reentry simulation event on Thursday, April 27, from 9:30 a.m. until noon at 605 N. Main St., Davenport, in the Seventh Judicial District building.</p><p>The goal of this free simulation is for participants to gain an understanding of the significant obstacles faced by men and women releasing from incarceration and returning home to their communities.</p><p>Participants will be given an opportunity to take part in an interactive learning experience through assigned profiles. To walk in the shoes of someone who is returning home gives invaluable insight for all community members.Individuals interested in participating in or volunteering for this event should contact <a href=#>BetterFuture@SaferFoundation.org</a>.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><strong>About Safer Foundation</strong></h3><p>Safer Foundation is one of the nation’s largest nonprofits working to disrupt the cycle of recidivism and social injustice in our society.
