Musically, it seemed too much of a departure from previous Beach Boys albums. Capitol held off on releasing singles and instead put out just two months after; it was, in their minds, a form of damage control to placate fans.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">However, to their surprise, became a No1 hit in Britain. In the US, it reached No10 on the charts, while made it to No8.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Wilson, who was 23 when he wrote , was inspired by the Beatles' album . The Fab Four responded the next year with . later proclaimed second on its list of the 500 greatest albums of all time, with first.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Is there a more perfect pop song than the eighth track on the album, ? Once, before playing it in concert in 2013, Wilson said: "Now we're going to play, I think, the best song I ever wrote."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/486w/public/2015/02/27/b7257bfe12275f31e3626ab33a8ca2de.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Last year, BBC Music brought together 32 singers, musicians and TV presenters - including Wilson, Elton John, Stevie Wonder, Pharrell Williams and Lorde - to perform the song with the BBC Concert Orchestra in a whimsical video.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In the mid-1970s, the Langley Schools Music Project, a group of Canadian primary school students in suburban Vancouver, led by music teacher Hans Fenger, recorded one of the most unsettling and charming covers of the track.
