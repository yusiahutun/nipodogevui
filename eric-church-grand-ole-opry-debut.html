In a precursor of the bold, unpredictable live shows that would become his signature, Church and his band segued into the Leadbelly classic "Black Betty."</p><p>"It was funny, we thought, 'Can we do Ram Jam at the Opry?' It was a last-minute decision before the late show, right before we walked out on stage," Church tells GAC (quote via the <a href=#>Boot</a>). "I told the guys, 'I'll give you a thumbs-up or thumbs-down.' So I gave them a thumbs-up, and we went for it. And the crowd loved it."</p><p>Church's grandmother had listened to the Grand Ole Opry on the radio all her life, and he had grown up steeped in its traditions. The night was especially sweet because she was among his guests in the audience for his debut.</p><p>"It was great for me — a dream come true. But I think it was more gratifying for me because my grandmother was there," Church recalls. "She [was] 84 years old [at the time], and for her, there is nothing bigger than the Opry. Her quote is, 'The Opry's bigger than Oprah.' I was really glad she got to be there. And Porter Wagoner is one of her favorites, so for Porter to introduce her grandson on the Opry was a really cool moment."</p><p><strong>Country Stars' Real Names Revealed:</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskajBprvFnKaupqSnxm%2BvzqZmnqqZmHqktNSrmqFll6eur7CMqKOeZZ%2Blv7p5w56Zrqxf</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./6516d59c268e3e516e8b45eb-html.html><span>←</span><span>Precio del dlar 29 de septiembre 2023: cotizacin en compra y venta</span></a>
