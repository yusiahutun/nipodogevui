During the interview, the journalist asked the singer questions about her virginity and accused her of being “unfaithful” to the Cry Me a River singer.</p><p>In the clip, Sawyer can be heard saying: “So much pain, so much suffering. What did you do?” in regard to the breakup.</p><p>Taking a deep breath, Britney responds “I was upset, I was upset for a while, we both…” before Diane interrupts by saying Justin had left the impression that she “wasn’t faithful and betrayed the relationship.”</p><p>A visibly upset Spears then continues to explain how everyone has their own side to the story.</p><p>Fans are now calling for Diane to apologize to the star, especially after recent revelations that she had an abortion after getting pregnant with Timberlake. She claims he said “they weren’t ready for a baby in their lives” and that they were “way too young.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-britney-deserves-an-apology>‘Britney deserves an apology’</h2><p>“Hey, @DianeSawyer don’t you think that it’s time to apologize to @britneyspears? This interview still makes me sick and now, even more! Shame on you!” exclaimed one fan.</p><p>Another tweeted: “She owes Britney an apology for that awful interview.”</p><p>“I hate this interview. It makes me sick that Diane Sawyer would treat a woman that way. She needs to publicly apologize and acknowledge her actions were so horrible and embarrassing for Britney,” wrote another.</p><p>One fan claimed: “This interview was disgusting. Britney was in a really emotional place, and Diane took every opportunity to dig into a young woman who wasn’t prepared to defend herself on national TV.”</p><p>In 2021, the Toxic singer condemned the interview herself sharing a long message on her <a href=#>Instagram</a>, which she later deleted.</p><p>“Do we dare forget the Diane Sawyer interview in my apartment almost 20 years ago?” she wrote on Instagram. “What was with the ‘You’re in the wrong’ approach?? Geeze…. and making me cry???” she wrote.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2023/10/GettyImages-451431979.jpg><p>During the breakup, Britney was portrayed as being “unfaithful” and she’s now calling out the media for how they portrayed her during this time.</p><p>In an expert from the memoir, as per the New York Times, she calls out the media for portraying her as a “harlot who’d broken the heart of America’s golden boy.”</p><p>She does, however, admit to being unfaithful, admitting that she made out with dancer Wade Robson one night. However, she says Justin was unfaithful too, with a <a href=#>celebrity</a>, who she doesn’t name.</p><p>The book, due to be released in a few days, delves deep into all moments of Britney’s life, as she reveals the <a href=#>reason she shaved her head</a> a year before her conservatorship started.</p><p>Singer Justin is yet to respond to any of the claims in Britney’s upcoming bombshell memoir.</p><p><strong>GRV Media has approached Justin Timberlake’s representatives for comment.</strong></p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFsZmpoX2aGcK7Roqunnalis6K60mabnqWRo7FuttSsq6KblWKzsL6MrqWemaKptaawjKKlrZ2iq7amw4ytn5qsXaKurLHSZquhnZ1is6axy2aqopubZA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./meek-mill-diss-track-the-game-ooouuu.html><span>←</span><span> Meek Mill Calls The Game a Gay Ex-Stripper on Diss Track</span></a>
