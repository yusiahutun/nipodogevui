(In real life, Mee's wife died after they moved in.) This is not the sort of film to offer drama or surprises; it's all a bit formulaic what with cute kids, troubled teens and a predictable romance. Nevertheless, its positive, uplifting story makes it a good choice for the festive season.</span></p><span type=text></span><p class="BodyParagraph__StyledBlockElement-sc-4sxwoh-0 hVXIcN Body__StyledBodyParagraph-sc-1cgoct-1 UAQBx" type=p><span type=text>Damon's portrayal of a loving father desperately hoping to help his family move on with life is realistic, but Scarlett Johansson's passionate zookeeper Kelly Foster is nice but not memorable.</span></p><span type=text></span><p class="BodyParagraph__StyledBlockElement-sc-4sxwoh-0 hVXIcN Body__StyledBodyParagraph-sc-1cgoct-1 UAQBx" type=p><span type=text>The stars of the show are the young actors - seven-year-old Maggie Jones as Rosie Mee and Colin Ford as her brother Dylan.
