&#34;I've tried Jack / I've tried Jim / I've tried every last one of them / Old heartbreak bottles up on that shelf / But the burn don't work and the buzz don't help / Been takin' these shots, shots, shots / 80, 90, everything they've got / But the whiskey don't kill like it's 'sposed to do / Baby, your memory must be bulletproof,&#34;"><meta name=author content="Reinaldo Massengill"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

He has become known for his honest lyrics as well as his boot-stomping melodies led by guitars and drums — and it works. Smith's previous tracks "Whiskey on You" and "World on Fire" both reached No. 1 on the Billboard Country Airplay chart.</p><p>It's all validation for the artist who&nbsp;nearly&nbsp;<a href=#>gave up</a> on music after 15 years in Nashville.</p><p>The breakup rally cry is the first track on his upcoming <a href=#>Through the Smoke</a> EP. Because the track sits in the leadoff position, it likely sets the tone for the rest of the project. Subsequent titles like "Wish I Never" and "Rather Be Lonely" lend themselves to breakup themes, as well.</p><h3>Here Are Nate Smith's "Bulletproof" Lyrics</h3><p>Usually these old neon lights / Are pretty good for bad goodbyes /&nbsp;I got some girls off of my mind /&nbsp;But baby not tonight /&nbsp;'Cause I've been puttin' in overtime /&nbsp;Trying to get over your leaving /&nbsp;You're still right here on my mind&nbsp;You sure did a number on me</p><p><strong>Chorus:</strong></p><p>I've tried Jack / I've tried Jim / I've tried every last one of them / Old heartbreak bottles up on that shelf / But the burn don't work and the buzz don't help / Been takin' these shots, shots, shots / 80, 90, everything they've got / But the whiskey don't kill like it's 'sposed to do / Baby, your memory must be bulletproof</p><p>There ain't no way I'm driving home / I'm three sheets, don't tie one on / But this liquor ain't as strong as your sweet lovin'</p><p><strong>Chorus</strong></p><p>All my favorite country songs / Guess they must've got it wrong / 'Cause I'm still here and you ain't gone / You ain't gone, baby</p><p><strong>Chorus</strong></p><p>All my favorite country songs / Guess they must've got it wrong / 'Cause I'm still here and you ain't gone / You ain't gone, baby / Oh-oh, you ain't gone, baby / Baby your memory must be bulletproof</p><h2 class=photogallery-title>Country Music's 50 Best Breakup Songs</h2><p>When your heart is hurting, country music has the right song for you.
