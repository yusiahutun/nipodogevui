Throw is the distance the projector requires to "throw" an image to the screen or the wall. There are three types of throw:</p><ul><li>Short throw</li><li>Long throw</li><li>Ultra-short throw</li></ul><p>This guide will focus on short throw and long throw projectors.</p><h2 id=long-throw-vs-short-throw>Long Throw vs. Short Throw?</h2><p>To put it simply, the difference between short and long throw projectors is how far from the screen that they are required to be set. Long throw projectors are meant to be positioned far away from a projection surface, whereas short throw projectors are meant to sit closer.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Long throw projector models can require up to six feet or more of available space between the projector and where the screen is mounted in order to reach the 100″ screen sizes limit, Long throw projectors are perfect for large spaces like churches, outdoor theaters, and concert halls.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>The Best Projector Screens for Your Home Theater</a></span></p><p>Short throw projectors are meant to be closer to the projection surface that they project onto. They possess a chip that modifies the geometry of the image projected so that the angled projection appears as a normal rectangle on the projection surface.</p><p>Short throw projectors have lenses that can create a much larger picture from shorter distances, or 100″ from four feet or less, depending on the model.</p><table border=1 cellpadding=1 cellspacing=1 align summary><tr><th><p>Type of Projector</p></th><th><p>Pros</p></th><th><p>Cons</p></th></tr><tbody><tr><td><p>Long Throw</p></td><td><p>• More moderately priced than short throw • Great for if the screen is not close to a power source • Less distortion even when placed on an uneven surface</p></td><td><p>• More susceptible to screen obstruction (shadows from people) • Prone to glare</p></td></tr></tbody><tbody><tr><td><p>Short Throw</p></td><td><p>• Less room for people to get in the way of the projector’s light. • Saves space Clearer image due to short distance</p></td><td><p>• Can get hot due to extra processing power • Even surface always required to avoid image warping</p></td></tr></tbody></table><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=dlp-lcd-or-lcos>DLP, LCD, or LCoS?</h2><p>Once you have established whether you want a long throw or a short throw projector, you have several options to choose from.</p><p>DLP and LCD projectors are two of the cheapest and best options, with LCD falling under $3500. LCoS projectors are more expensive than DLP and LCD, typically retailing between $3,000-$25,000.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>VAVA 4K Ultra Short Throw Projector Review: A Home Entertainment Powerhouse</a></span></p><p>DLP projectors use a color wheel as well as a light source and tilting mirrors to produce the projected image. They are often smaller and lighter. Oftentimes, they show more contrast than their LCD counterparts.</p><p>LCD projectors use a light source that passes through three RGB (red, green, and blue) chips. These chips create and project the images. Images from an LCD projector tend to appear brighter than those from a DLP. Brightness is especially important if you have a lot of light in your room. Ultimately, the quality of both types of projector is really good, to the point that there isn’t much of a difference when used as a projector for TV and movies within your home.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>LCoS projectors are best known for great color, superb black levels, least visible pixel structure, and accurate performance.</p><h2 id=good-options-for-projectors>Good Options for Projectors</h2><p>Whether you choose a long throw or short throw projector, you cannot go wrong. Either option can prove to be a nice touch to your home entertainment setup. Your personal preferences for your visual experience are likely to be the greatest factor determining which option you prefer, as well as the dimensions of the room you'll be using the project in.</p><p>For those more concerned about costs, they may find the long-throw option to be a better option as long-throw projectors are usually cheaper than short-throw models.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rq3KnqysnZ%2Bbe6S7zGibop6Wmr%2BmusKeZKWnnpx6tbTRqK5mq5ikv7V506GpqK9dpb%2BwtsScq6iqXw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./kate-hudson-healthy-cocktail-sparks-debate.html><span>←</span><span>Kate Hudson's controversial cocktail combination sparks fan reaction</span></a>
