I hope you all know, and I pray that Jenny knew, that it works in reverse too! The smallest little gesture, from you. The tiniest little smile. The thoughtful little gifts. The funniest little joke. <strong>The love that you so consistently share with us — means so much, too!</strong> It may not seem like it can lift us — but it does!"</p><p id=eYT06csItNF0 data-wc=69>He continued: "One kind word can be the fuel that inspires. It can spread through me, or my band, and touch the hearts of an arena filled with people. A smile from the front row, can reflect off of me and touch somebody in the very last row.
