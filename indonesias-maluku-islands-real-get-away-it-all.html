The Indonesian resort of Oanain Munina, though, is the real deal.</p><p datatype="p" class="c2 e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31" id=U10830070669qIC data-qa=Component-Component>On the north coast of Seram – which, at 340km long, may be one of the largest islands you’ve never heard of – the property’s wooden buildings perch on stilts above shallow waters alive with colourful fish. On one side is a small village, Sawai; otherwise, this part of the world appears deserted. The sea bounds the horizon; behind rise steep hillsides covered in dense rainforest. The manager is rarely to be seen and the only staff we notice are a couple of women who bring out meals, then disappear again.</p><p datatype="p" class="c2 e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31" id=U10830070669uVF data-qa=Component-Component>Set on its own tectonic microplate in the central Maluku Islands, in the east of Indonesia, Seram is 15 times larger than all of Hong Kong, with a resident population of about 170,000. Much of the interior is unexplored by outsiders, although I’ve read two accounts of climbs to the highest point, 3,027 metres; the author of one of these finished with feet so sore and swollen he spent six days in hospital.</p><p datatype="p" class="c2 e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31" id=U10830070669JMC data-qa=Component-Component>Although the jungle-clad hillsides exude a certain appeal, I am, therefore, content to have experienced them from the road as we travelled from south Seram, stopping at times as my guide, Vinno Soewarian, helped spot birds such as the aptly named rainbow lorikeet and the salmon-crested cockatoo, a close relative of the cockatoos that wheel above Hong Kong’s Central district.</p><p datatype="p" class="c2 e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31" id=U10830070669i3F data-qa=Component-Component>There are more winged wonders in view as we ride an outsize, motor-powered longboat into the mouth of the Salawai river and up past rows of nipa palms that have adapted to life in the tidal zone. Birds, however, are not our main quarry.</p><p datatype="p" class="c2 e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31" id=U10830070669G8B data-qa=Component-Component>“There are often crocodiles here, but it’s not sunny today,” says Soewarian, as we arrive at a river bend with a grassy bank. It’s probable, though, that several saltwater crocs – billed online as “the animal most likely to eat a human” – are lurking close by. I keep my hands clear of the murky water, just in case.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/660x385/public/images/methode/2016/11/17/5d53f6fc-a64f-11e6-a836-75a661626cad_660x385.JPG?itok=2IZchHGK"><p datatype="p" class="c2 e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31" id=U10830070669nKC data-qa=Component-Component>After cruising back down the river, we head offshore and stop at a tiny islet. Behind its fine sand beach is a scrawny wood, the branches of which bear five olive honeyeaters. Though rather drab little birds, they are intriguing because they abound in this spot during September but are yet to be found on Seram or nearby islets.</p><p datatype="p" class="c2 e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31" id=U10830070669HjC data-qa=Component-Component>The Maluku Islands are in the Coral Triangle, the global centre of marine biodiversity, and Soewarian says this islet is good for swimming. Electric blue fish surround me as I wade into the shallow waters, the underwater land­scape dominated by green and brick-red branching corals, reddish brain corals and waving fronds of algae. Two clown fish rocket out of an anemone and swim up close, reminding me of Nemo’s dad, seemingly spoiling for a fight and declaring, “This is our anemone. Go away!”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/660x385/public/images/methode/2016/11/17/0e02077e-a64f-11e6-a836-75a661626cad_660x385.JPG?itok=KqYKvTRs"><p datatype="p" class="c2 e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31" id=U10830070669PXE data-qa=Component-Component>With business slow on a weekday, the Oanain Munina’s manager, who has finally put in an appearance, takes us on a stroll through Sawai.</p><p datatype="p" class="c2 e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31" id=U10830070669Vq data-qa=Component-Component>Some of the single-storey houses are built on firm ground, others are on stilts above the sea. School’s out for the day and young children are everywhere, a group of them busy sorting freshly harvested cloves. Some of the boys swim in a spring-fed pool at the base of the limestone hills the village backs onto while women sit on tiled steps around the pool, washing clothes in clear water that then flows beneath a bridge and out to sea.</p><p datatype="p" class="noindent c2 e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31" id=U10830070669EDG data-qa=Component-Component><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">WE LEAVE THE SERAM</strong> town of Masohi from a small wharf on a large, fast ferry. Towards the end of the two-hour journey, as we near Ambon Island, eight or more striped dolphins swim across our wake and leap into the air. Two shoot vertically upwards until they’re a couple of body lengths – about four metres – clear of the water, before splashing back down.</p><a class="colorbox colorbox-insert-image euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0"><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/486w/public/images/methode/2016/11/17/6de3e950-a64f-11e6-a836-75a661626cad_486x.JPG?itok=gmD2RXnX"></span></a>Although one-twentieth the size of Seram, Ambon, to the south, has almost twice the population, and hosts one of the main cities in eastern Indonesia, also known as Ambon. One of the main Spice Islands, Ambon was known for its cloves.<p datatype="p" class="c2 e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31" id=U10830070669eIE data-qa=Component-Component>The words “spice islands” may conjure up images of an exotic tropical paradise but this region has known bloody and brutal periods. We find evidence of some of those a short boat ride to the east, in Haruku village, on Haruku Island.</p><p datatype="p" class="c2 e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31" id=U10830070669DMB data-qa=Component-Component>A thick stone wall and archway are most of what remains of a 17th-century fort built to help the Dutch East India Company maintain control of the spice trade. Nearby, an almost finished church rises from the platform of its predecessor, which was destroyed around the turn of this century, when the village was attacked by people from Ambon during internecine warfare that shook the Maluku Islands.</p><p datatype="p" class="c2 e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31" id=U108300706697b data-qa=Component-Component>We’re shown around the now peaceful village by Eliza Kissya, a soft-spoken man with a bushy grey beard.

Trees shade the area and at the back of his house is a cluster of mangrove saplings ready for planting, along with two cages with wire mesh sides in which he keeps an adult and two young megapodes. He buys eggs collected by fellow villagers and rears the hatchlings until they are more than three months old, and better able to evade predators. Then, it’s time to set them free.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/236w/public/images/methode/2016/11/17/8000948a-a64f-11e6-a836-75a661626cad_236x.JPG?itok=zeNXEuIE"><p datatype="p" class="c2 e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31" id=U10830070669Lr data-qa=Component-Component>“My dream can come true,” he says. “The birds can colour the world again.”</p><p datatype="p" class="c2 e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31" id=U10830070669cNF data-qa=Component-Component>If he’s not successful in this back of beyond, what hope is there for the rest of the planet?</p><p datatype="p" class="c2 e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31" data-qa=Component-Component>&nbsp;</p><p datatype="p" class="c5 e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31" data-qa=Component-Component>&nbsp;</p><p datatype="p" class="c5 e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31" id=U10830070669YVH data-qa=Component-Component><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">Getting there:</strong> from Jakarta, fly to Ambon, from where ferries run to Masohi, in south Seram.
