What it means</h1></header><section class=post-content><p class=align-left><strong>The human subconscious is quite fascinating. Most people feel they are in control when their brain figures out a puzzle or hacks a complicated query, but there is much going on underneath the surface of the conscious mind. And dreams show the immense capability of the subconscious. Dreams allow the subconscious mind to communicate with your conscious mind. In a way, when things do not turn out as planned, your subconscious attempts to play them the way you would have wanted them to go, in your dreams. That is the most basic interpretation of dreams. What if you are often dreaming about someone trying to hurt you? How can you interpret it?</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/f92a7375fca21db2.jpeg><p class=align-left>You are less likely to recall a dream as the event mainly occurs during your REM (rapid eye movement) sleep phase. However, if you dream about something horrifying, you certainly will remember it in the morning if you will not hastily wake up in the middle of the night in fear.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/fc84aa2d324661a7.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>What is the spiritual meaning of dreaming about water? Everything to know</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Sometimes, it might be a dream of someone trying to kill you with a knife or something you dread suddenly appearing in your dream, making your night terrorising. Is there a way of interpreting such dreams?</p><h2>Dreaming about someone trying to hurt you? Meaning</h2><p class=align-left>What does it mean when someone tries to attack you in a dream? It is said that dreams <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">represent the feelings</a> that the dreamer undergoes in real life. Therefore, having a nightmare about someone else trying to hurt you can be a terrifying encounter.</p><p class=align-left>You likely have many questions regarding such happenings in your mind's subconscious when you are asleep. But, don't fret; there are specific possible interpretations of such a dream that will keep you at ease.</p><p class=align-left>However, remember that dream interpretation of someone trying to hurt you ought not to be taken literally. The primary reason for this is that such an interpretation only shows the possibility and not the answers. The ideal way of deciphering <a href=#>dreams</a>, especially those related to killing, is to consider the context.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/53ed652295adc9e5.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>What does dreaming that someone is pregnant actually mean?</span></p></a><h3>The individual trying to kill you</h3><p class=align-left>Who was trying to hurt you in your dream? Is it someone you know or a stranger? If the person attempting to kill you in your dream is a friend, partner, enemy, etc., then there is a high chance that you are afraid of them.</p><p class=align-left>For instance, if you dream of an acquittance killing you in your dream, there is a high chance that you might have hurt them, and your conscience is killing you from the inside.</p><p class=align-left>And of course, the perfect solution when you dream about someone who has hurt you is to make amends with the individual. It is the only way to find peace if the dream keeps recurring.</p><p class=align-left>Another situation that ordinarily happens in dreams of being attacked is the familiar individual attempting to control you. Such a dream means escaping a particular situation and not wanting to face what you fear. It might be a matter that is troubling you that it haunts you in your dreams, hence the horrifying experience.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/c47f8a3ed8840892.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>40+ long paragraphs for your crush to express your feelings</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Sometimes, you might dream about a stranger trying to hurt you. Such a situation is weird for most people, considering dreams reflect one's experience in real life. However, don't be alarmed when you spot an unknown individual trying to hurt you, as it has a simple interpretation.</p><p class=align-left>Such a person represents a certain quality that you are afraid of or a situation you are escaping from. For instance, the killer might mean your fear of rejection or the extreme pressure you are experiencing in your <a href=#>life</a> because of people’s expectations of you.</p><p class=align-left>Another interesting interpretation of dreams of being attacked is that it might warn of impending danger in your life. Thus, the dream might be a sign that you ought to take precautions to protect yourself from whatever might harm you in future. But, on the other hand, if you escaped in your dream, it is a positive sign that you will overcome your difficulties.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/2d1b6f93f4fef94b.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Why do I keep dreaming about the same person over and over?</span></p></a><h3>How was the person trying to kill you?</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/fc84aa2d324661a7.jpeg><p class=align-left>Getting hurt in a dream and feeling it is a terrifying experience. Although it is not real, it feels natural when dreaming, and one can hardly <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">distinguish the difference</a>. How was the person in the dream trying to kill you? Such details provide great insight when attempting to decipher a <a href=#>dream</a>.</p><p class=align-left>For example, if the person is attacking you from behind, it might mean that you are lying to yourself or someone else. Also, such can symbolise your insecurities.</p><p class=align-left>Sometimes, your dream can be so intense that your tormentor slits your throat. Of course, it is an unimaginable experience that would give many people sleepless nights. Fortunately, the event has a simple interpretation. The dream means that you ought to find your voice and speak for things that you believe in.</p><h3>What weapon was used in your dream?</h3><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/c080f0700572d346.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>How to pull away emotionally from a guy you love</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Are you still wondering, “What does it mean to dream someone is trying to hurt you?” The dream <a href=#>world</a> has <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">numerous dynamics</a>, and it is hard attaching one meaning. You can use the weapon the person was using to hurt you to interpret it. How do you do this?</p><p class=align-left>If the person used a knife to cut, wound, or stab you, then it means that your inner self or another person is utilising sharp words to judge you, and you are suffering in silence about it. However, if they fired the weapon from a distance, then it shows distant danger.</p><p class=align-left>Always remember that dreams are a reflection of what is going on in your life. Also, it is not a mirror image, and you shouldn't take it as such (you are not going to be physically attacked by someone just because you dreamt about it).</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/37680e627e1181e2.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>How to reject a girl politely without hurting her feelings</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Of course, dreaming about someone trying to hurt you can be a great shock, and you will likely remember most of it. However, to decipher a dream precisely, it is a good idea to seek the assistance of psychics who specialise in dream meaning. Such professionals can give you an interpretation specifically tailored for you.</p><p class=align-left>Does dreaming about someone means they miss you? <a href=#>Tuko.co.ke</a> featured an interesting <a href=#>article</a> about the common ideology in contemporary society, giving different reasons why people have such dreams.</p><p class=align-left>You have likely had such a dream, not once, but often. However, the significant problems with dreams are that they are hardly memorable, and people forget about the event within hours of waking from sleep. So, is it possible that when you dream about someone, they cannot wait to meet you?</p><p></p><strong class=article-ytsubscribe__title>Subscribe to watch new videos</strong><p>Source: TUKO.co.ke</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tcHKqGWcp16gsnCAkW5pcnBdmb%2BmrcyipaBlmKq%2FtXnWoZitZZ2arq%2B%2FjaGrpqQ%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./zuri-hall.html><span>←</span><span>Who is Zuri Hall dating?
