class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Crossing lines through comedy is an increasingly treacherous business in Asia, several comedians told This Week in Asia, where race, identity and politics may play well inside a comedy club but can draw dangerous levels of outcry once on the internet.</p><a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=#

css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Indian stand-up comedian Radha Karia, 33, said given the climate of heightened sensitivity and the strong presence of mob vigilantism on social media, she had been extra careful about what she posts online, fearing that someday it might come back to haunt her.</p>“The internet in <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">India</span></a> has become very cheap, a lot of people have access to it and when that happens, everybody has an opinion and everyone can get offended,” she said. “Indians are generally more sensitive when it comes to religion, culture, the language – anything.”<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">When the authorities and online mobs stalk the internet, self-censorship is the outcome, she said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“From the start, [show producers] would tell you not to make jokes about religion, jokes about the government or jokes that might

class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Many comics have internalised the boundaries – on race, religion and incendiary political issues – instinctively knowing that the barometer of decency is calibrated differently in different places.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“You don’t have the right to cross the line on someone else’s life,” said Singapore’s best-known comic, known by the mononym Kumar. “You don’t get too personal … Sometimes when I do it, I will always say sorry because I will feel like I did something wrong.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">However, the imaginary line separating ‘edgy’ and ‘offensive’ from ‘illegal’ has become increasingly blurred – and crossing it can mean jail time.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In India, stand-up comic Munawar Faruqui, who has been accused of cracking jokes that insulted Hinduism during a comedy show in Indore, was detained for 37 days by police in 2021.</p>In Malaysia, operations at Crackhouse Comedy Club House were <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60

data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">One Malaysian comedian, who declined to be named fearing a backlash, said comics were trying to put up a “united front”, insisting spirits had remained “quite strong throughout it all”.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Indian comic Ankur Tangade has received rape and death threats, on top of being stalked, after being part of a show which had a line-up of comedians from the Dalit community, who are the bottom of the Hindu caste structure.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I thought I’d try my best to not offend anyone since as a comedian, my job is to make people happy,” she said. “But I realised that people will hate on you even though they don’t know what I talk about on stage. So I stopped trying to please everyone.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/06/23/8ea89d64-9745-4296-acd9-bf3b15774e7d_8ead1f4c.jpg>Experts speculate that in <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Southeast Asia</span></a>, security and social cohesion may take precedence over freedom of expression – in stark contrast to that of liberal democracies such as the US.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">There are also political forces at play, said Ang Peng Hwa, a professor of communication studies at Singapore’s Nanyang Technological University, suggesting outrage at Chia’s joke – while offensive to many Malaysians – was juiced up by some factions looking for quick leverage.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">A small rally by the youth wing of right-wing Malay nationalist party Umno was held at the US embassy on June 9, a few days after Chia’s gag did the rounds.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I view this as a highly political incident, politicised for whatever ends that these people may want to have,” Ang said. “We are not exactly following the West to the same extent of cancel culture. But people are looking and seeing how one might use it to cancel people they don’t like.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Context remains the rule governing a good joke and the best laughs are often won in local languages including Bahasa Melayu, Tagalog or Mandarin, said Singaporean comic Jacky Ng.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“We live in different parts of the world and we see the world so differently,” he said, seeing the outcry over Chia’s skit as an occupational hazard of comedy in the internet age.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I think what happened has happened before, and will continue to keep happening: a comedian has a good set in the club, posted a clip of the performance online and people online take the clip out of context and react extraordinarily,” he said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Personally, I will continue to do my own style of comedy and keep trying to improve as a comedian.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kxKaxymaYrKGRZL2mu8%2BlnGiZoqm2pLjEaGpramVmg3R7zJqjmrGjnq5ur8Cnmp6ko2K3sK%2FEpbCnZZOdtqJ5wKygmqtdmLyutcKsZKiolaN6s7XSpKpmm6KkwLS1zaBkpaGemg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./44-facts-about-liza-weil.html><span>←</span><span>44 Facts About Liza Weil</span></a>
