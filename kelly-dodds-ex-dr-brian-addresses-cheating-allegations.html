Absolutely not."</p><p>"I heard she's moved on," he added. "I'm very happy for her."</p><p>Reaching for the door of the restaurant, the plastic surgeon was given one more opportunity.

A little less than two weeks ago -- after Kelly <strong><a href=#>announced on Instagram</a></strong> that she and Dr. Brian had broken up -- he told Page Six, "Kelly and I are no longer dating. I completely deny having cheated on her. Completely. That's not why we're not dating."</p><p>"I simply cannot make her see -- I'm not there all the time -- she's reacting. There are other things that have happened. I'm not going to share. And that's it," he continued.</p><p>"My focus is on my son and my career," he added. "I regret ever getting involved in [reality TV] ... but this is my life and I'm just gonna get back to being a good dad, a good surgeon."</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:93306a03-757e-57f9-ba7c-30bdcb627a8b data-container-ref=toofab:article:d3c29a6b-5386-509e-afed-2f2391a408f4 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=28><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/18/5by4/2019/08/21/18bb444f2222599290b87534a8d9c7aa_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Bravo</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Kelly Dodd Fires Back at 'Idiot' Vicki Gunvalson for Doubling Down on Cocaine Accusations</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>Shortly after announcing the split, Kelly revealed she was dating someone new: Fox News correspondent Rick Leventhal. But in true Kelly fashion, both announcements were nothing short of entertaining.</p><p>In a series of Instagram Stories posted while out with friends, the reality star shouted, "The universe is telling me I broke up with Dr. Brian. Wooo! And they all know why."</p><p>After insinuating that Dr. Brian hadn't taken her side in an argument, Kelly declared that their relationship was officially over.</p><p>"This is why I'm breaking up with Brian for good. This is the last time," she said. "No going back to this asshole. At all."</p><p>Kelly celebrated the breakup by singing along to Queen's "Another One Bites the Dust," saying, "Here's our song. I broke up with Dr. Brian. Another one bites the dust!"</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:660ea585-8fc4-55dd-91c9-abd70e852176 data-container-ref=toofab:article:d3c29a6b-5386-509e-afed-2f2391a408f4 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=28><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/f5/5by4/2019/08/13/f5173f1773b0586fbccb7b19bbc1b2e2_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Bravo</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">'RHOC' Recap: Tamra Calls Vicki 'The Most Insecure Person' Before Kelly's Shocking Pig Video Causes Chaos</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>"We met in the Hamptons," Kelly told PEOPLE of her 59-year-old new beau. "It's new, we haven't even had sex.

At the time, they had been dating for only three months, but Kelly maintained she was "in love." Dr. Brian even called her into his office to give her a pair of rose-gold, rain-drop diamond earrings.</p><p>To his face, Kelly was grateful and put the earrings on right away. But in her confessional, she was grateful it wasn't a ring "because that's not the way I wanna be proposed to. I would probably say no in a small office like this."</p><p>After a brief split in July, the twosome reconciled, but things appear to be over for good.</p><p>"The Real Housewives of Orange County" airs Tuesdays at 9 p.m. on Bravo.</p><p><strong>Got a story or a tip for us?
