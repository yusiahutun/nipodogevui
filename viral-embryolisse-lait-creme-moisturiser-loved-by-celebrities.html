After revisiting the multipurpose cream recently, it's going to be holding a permanent spot as my daytime moisturiser – and this is why.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/f9de1e8b8281-embryolisse-personal-pic.jpg><p id=eKwFZY0N1qQ data-wc=55>Plenty of celebrities have been said to use Embryolisse regularly, and Celebrity makeup artist <a class=hm-link href=# rel="noopenernofollow nofollow">Emily Clarkson</a> consistently reaches for the multifunctional product on her star clients including <a class=hm-link href=#>Michelle Keegan</a> and Perrie Edwards. The makeup pro shares her work on her Instagram with product breakdowns, and the cream is often at the top of the list.&nbsp;</p><p id=eI-Mlp7KMHu data-wc=58>The first thing I noticed about the moisturiser was the new packaging. The brand hasn't strayed too far from its original appearance, but I was glad to see that they hadn't seemed to change the formula too, as the texture felt exactly the same. The cream retails at £21, but it's currently on sale for <span><a class=hm-link href=# rel="sponsored noopenernofollow nofollow">£15.99</a></span> / <span><a class=hm-link href=# rel="sponsored noopenernofollow nofollow">$15.30</a></span>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/88bd32f61bd2-michelle-keegan-skin.jpg><p id=e8Vrs9eDWco data-wc=44>The lightweight formula blends straight into the skin, and as it's designed to be a primer too, it gives a smooth base feel that helps my foundation to glide on nicely without leaving any build-up, which is something I've experienced with my thicker moisturisers.&nbsp;</p><p id=e03w4U13MRt data-wc=55>As my skin is dry, I worried that the Embryolisse cream wouldn't provide enough nourishment to keep my skin feeling soft in the cold weather, but the cream is filled with nutrients and water which managed to keep my skin feeling smooth all day, before I switch it out for a thicker option for overnight.&nbsp;</p><p id=eyThvm1L2d_ data-wc=77>The moisturiser is suitable for all skin types, and while I know it works on my dry skin, I can imagine that it would be just as effective on combination and <a class=hm-link href=#>oily skin</a>, as the lightweight texture provides a glow without feeling greasy. The cream does leave a white cast if you apply too much, but I find a little goes a long way, so there's no need to use more than a pea size at once.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/42dd865a54ff-perrie-edwards.jpg><p id=ea0b0dL8woo data-wc=50>Marketed as multifunctional cream, the Lait-Crème Concentré can be used as a moisturiser, primer, mask, and even a makeup remover. I don't think I will be using it as a makeup remover, but I'll definitely be trying it out as a face mask when my skin needs some extra hydration.&nbsp;</p><a href=# class=buttonWidgetButtonLink_b94rpwz rel="sponsored nofollow"><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/d789e182d26f-embryolisse-moisturiser.png></a><a href=# class="buttonWidgetButton_b1lxbopb buttonClass_by57jsl -primary" rel="sponsored nofollow"><p>£15.99 (SAVE £6) AT LOOK FANTASTIC</p></a><a href=# class="buttonWidgetButton_b1lxbopb buttonClass_by57jsl -primary" rel="sponsored nofollow"><p>£21 AT BOOTS</p></a><a href=# class="buttonWidgetButton_b1lxbopb buttonClass_by57jsl -primary" rel="sponsored nofollow"><p>$15.30 AT AMAZON</p></a><p id=eF-lgQ5ISdZ data-wc=75>Hundreds of people have shared TikToks raving about the cult moisturiser, and makeup artist and influencer Kevi Kodra said in his video: "This moisturiser is Hollywood's biggest secret.

I’ve tried ALOT and this beats them all. Super lightweight and sits under makeup lovely. Five stars!"</p><p id=eUl-3BFN8Hs data-wc=29>Another wrote: "Fab makeup base! Any other primer I’ve tried just doesn’t cut it and my makeup just goes blotchy. This leaves my foundation looking glossy but not oily."</p><h2 dir=ltr>Final verdict on the Embryolisse moisturiser</h2><p id=eRu4NTYj3T data-wc=48>If you regularly wear makeup and want to build a base for your foundation to glide on flawlessly, the Embryolisse is definitely worth the hype. I think this is really worth trying no matter your skin type, and I can't wait to try it as a face mask.&nbsp;</p><h4 class="relatedContentTitleClass_r14hzpr7 hm-heading">You may also like</h4><ul class=relatedContentListClass_ra09n5z><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="9 best moisturisers for dry skin: Hydrating face creams tried & tested" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/6402282d3a5c-best-moisturiser-for-dry-skin-t.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="9 best moisturisers for dry skin: Hydrating face creams tried & tested" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>9 best moisturisers for dry skin: Hydrating face creams tried & tested</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="I'm 43 & I tried snail mucin for ‘glass skin’ because the TikTokkers told me to - here’s what I honestly think" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/c751611a6cfb-snail-essence.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="I'm 43 & I tried snail mucin for ‘glass skin’ because the TikTokkers told me to - here’s what I honestly think" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>I'm 43 & I tried snail mucin for ‘glass skin’ because the TikTokkers told me to - here’s what I honestly think</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="Winter has wreaked havoc with my skin so I tried Japanese skincare Tatcha to see if it would make a difference - here’s what happened" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/60f460dfde9c-tatcha-tried-and-tested-leanne-bayley.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="Winter has wreaked havoc with my skin so I tried Japanese skincare Tatcha to see if it would make a difference - here’s what happened" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>Winter has wreaked havoc with my skin so I tried Japanese skincare Tatcha to see if it would make a difference - here’s what happened</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li></ul><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
