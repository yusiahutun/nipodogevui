Nick and his wife filed for divorce only&nbsp;in May 2014, which implied that Katharine cheated on her husband.&nbsp;</p><p style=text-align:justify>The divorce settlement revealed that Katharine was ordered to pay a sum of $102,616 along with alimony payment of $400,000 per year or $33,333 per month. It did make&nbsp;Nick a rich man, with his net worth already&nbsp;amounting to $6 million. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2 style=text-align:justify>Nick Cokas &&nbsp;Katharine McPhee Post-Divorce</h2><p style=text-align:justify>Despite the divorce, fans were hoping to see Nick and Katharine put aside their differences and reconcile their romance. And, Katharine was also spotted with her ex-husband - a tall guy with a height of nearly six feet - in 2014 which made the fans optimistic about the duo.</p><p style=text-align:justify>However, the couple had separated for good and were in no condition to get back together.&nbsp;Soon after the divorce, Katharine - now age 34 - <a href=# rel=follow>started dating Canadian musician, David Foster</a> and the lovers <a href=# rel=follow>got engaged in June 2018</a>.</p><p style=text-align:justify></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p style=text-align:justify><strong>Katharine McPhee with fiance David Foster at the Oscar Awards after party in West Hollywood California on 4 March 2018</strong> (Photo: USMagazine.com)</p><p style=text-align:justify>Interestingly, David had been a guest at Katharine's first wedding and Nick probably never imagined that he would get backstabbed by a friend.&nbsp;Talking about Nick, the 53-year-old is single, and his dream of starting a family may have been halted for now. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-655></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmikmauys63MqaypZpOkunCxza2cq6yRnruusc2tZqehk6B6pLvKmqpmppWperi70a2fZq%2BZm7JussCmoKWxXp3Brrg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./frasier-sequel-cast-anders-keith-niles-daphnes-son-html.html><span>←</span><span>Frasier sequel has cast Anders Keith as Niles and Daphne's son</span></a>
