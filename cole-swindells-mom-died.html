"She's the one that, no matter how stressed out I get, if I wanna be here or wanna be there, she is always the first person to remind me, 'Come on, Cole. Think about it. Me and you would have never thought you'd be where you are right now.' I always say that, but I mean it because it takes someone like her to put it all in perspective."</p><p>"Lost my sweet mom today," Swindell&nbsp;writes&nbsp;in an Instagram Story post&nbsp;shared Monday evening (Sept. 13). The picture&nbsp;is of the clouds, taken&nbsp;during his flight home to Georgia.</p><figure class="img-tag has-sizer aligncenter" readability=2><p><span class=visually-hidden>attachment-Cole Swindell Mom</span></p>Instagram/ColeSwindell<p>loading...</p></figure><p>Rainey's age or the circumstances around her death have not yet been shared.</p><p>Musically, Swindell is scheduled to return to the road on Thursday as the opening act for <a href=#>Thomas Rhett</a>'s Center Point Road Tour, which runs into the fall.
