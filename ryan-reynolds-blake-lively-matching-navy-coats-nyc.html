The lovebirds strutted the streets of New York City wearing matching navy blue coats. The&nbsp;Gossip Girl&nbsp;actress’ coat was made out of wool and went down to her knees while the&nbsp;Deadpool&nbsp;actor wore a shorter puffy jacket. They twinned from head to toe as they had matching wool hats and jeans (Blake’s were the Emilie Straight in Light Seaglass by DL1961).</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Blake-Lively-Ryan-Reynolds-nyc-mega-post.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-3>The streets of NYC have become a runway for the couple to show off their latest looks. Most recently, the <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>actress</a> modeled the same cozy-looking coat and funky patterned pants as her actor husband wore a navy blue vest and a grey long-sleeved shirt. They showed off their <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Fall fashion</a> as Blake wore a black turtleneck and high-waisted jeans and a suede jacket with a green button-down and jeans.</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>The Marvel star certainly gave the DL on his and his wife’s <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>sex life</a> when he switched places with&nbsp;<strong><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Will Ferrell</a>.&nbsp;</strong>Ryan showed up at Will’s&nbsp;<i><a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>The Tonight&nbsp;Show Starring Jimmy Fallon</a> i</i>nterview while Will took Ryan’s place at <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Jimmy Kimmel Live</a>. “Blake is great. The sex is totally normal,” the&nbsp;Red Notice actor said off the cuff as he kicked off his surprise appearance with <strong>Jimmy Fallon.</strong> Their intimacy must be good enough because they share three kids <strong>James</strong>, 6,&nbsp;<strong>Inez</strong>, 5, and&nbsp;<strong>Betty</strong>, 2.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Ryan-Reynolds-blake-livelyDaughters-shutter-embed-2.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-5>Ryan is a proud dad and is even taking a <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>break</a> from his acting career to spend more time with his little ones.“Well I think my goal in taking a break is to spend as much quality time with my kids at this age as possible. That doesn’t mean I am retiring or anything crazy like that,” he EXCLUSIVELY told&nbsp;<strong>HollywoodLife&nbsp;</strong>of his time off. The coronavirus pandemic pushed his projects on top of each other which was really hectic for him so he’s looking forward to winding down.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>So how do they make their 10-year <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>marriage</a> work as A-list actors? “We don’t take each other too serious, but we’re also friends,” Ryan told <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>ET</a> of his marriage. “Falling in love is great, but do you like each other? That’s the question you gotta ask yourself, you know, going into it. We’ve always liked each other. We grow together. We learn from each other. So yeah, I’m lucky to have a buddy in that.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpiZH1ye5FuZquxkaN6s7HYp6alnKNir62typ5kpaGmmrm6ecyaq5ygmaO0brrAr7Bmm5%2BWwbR5zbKaaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./raspberry-juice-blood-sugar-study.html><span>←</span><span>Raspberry Juice Could Help With Blood Sugar Control</span></a>
