The man in the corner snapping pictures was someone&nbsp;the singer was familiar with.</p><p>The Bobby Bones Show personality&nbsp;Lunchbox (real name: Dan Chappell) shared pictures and an account of&nbsp;the "<a href=#>Getting Over You</a>" singer's actions in since-deleted tweets. The pictures were taken from behind Alaina.</p><p>"I creeped from the corner," he wrote, tagging both&nbsp;her and Chipotle, where she was dining.</p><p>"I feel like saying hi would have been a lot less weird than booty pics. Lol," Alaina tweeted back.</p><p>Alaina's followers on Twitter were not as soft with their response.</p><p>"So disrespectful and creepy," @coypaulbailey writes. "Girl ... don't feel obligated to "lol" — Creepy is creepy," @MissDS17 says.</p><p>The original tweet was sent just before 8AM CT on Wednesday morning (Dec. 8), with Alaina responding just a couple of hours later.</p><p>"She was eating by herself, took a call, and then a friend showed up. Highlight was when she spilled her drink," Lunchbox wrote,&nbsp;going on to explain how Alaina was very kind to the employee who mopped it up.</p><p>On Thursday and Friday, the Bobby Bones Show has been focused on their annual St. Jude Children's Hospital Radiothon. Bones, Lunchbox or the show have not referred to the incident any further via social media or on the show's&nbsp;<a href=#>website.</a>&nbsp;Alaina hasn't commented on the controversy again either, but others have, including singer and Apple Music host <a href=#>Kelleigh Bannen</a>.</p><p>"Getting Over You" is Alaina's current Top 40 single, a duet with <a href=#>Jon Pardi</a>. In September, she released her third studio album,&nbsp;Sitting Pretty On Top of the World. Earlier this week she announced her headlining <a href=#>Top of the World Tour</a>, beginning in February of 2022.</p><h2 class=photogallery-title>PICTURES: See Inside Carrie Underwood's Beautiful Post-'American Idol' Home</h2><p>Carrie Underwood invested her money wisely after winning American Idol in 2005. One of her first big purchases was a 3,099-square-foot home in the well-to-do Nashville suburb of Franklin, Tenn. Underwood paid $384,000 for a luxurious 3-bedroom, 3.5-bathroom stone and stucco home in a private gated community.</p><p>The house features a library, a vaulted ceiling and lovely amenities throughout, but while it's very nice, it's certainly not the kind of home you'd picture for a budding country superstar. Underwood wound up being a huge success right out of the gate with her debut album, Some Hearts, and she sold the home in Franklin for $372,500 in 2007, when she purchased the Brentwood mansion that she would later share with her husband, Mike Fisher.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskajBprvFnKaupqSnxm%2BvzqZmpZmlp7KvecClmKKmkWK5trrCoZmosF2XvKOu2GaZqKaVqHq0tM6wZKmhk6nCs7HSaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./isaac-mizrahi-wild-one-pet-collection.html><span>←</span><span>Isaac Mizrahi and Wild One Just Launched A Pet Accessories Collection</span></a>
