The smooch, she remembered, made her feel like a little girl again.</p><p id=eCUlVGf3ss0 data-wc=61>“On the way down the stairs after the scene, I was hopping like a bunny. I hop like a bunny when I’m happy – I get a bit childlike. He gives me the Christmas Eve jitters – that feeling you had as a child,” she said. “You’re wiggling your feet underneath the covers because something exciting is going to happen tomorrow.”</p><p id=eQ1VNDF8fZ data-wc=25>And, following Russell’s <a class=hm-link href=#>extravagant Indian proposal</a> on New Year's Eve, she revealed it’s not just her husband-to-be who makes the extravagant gestures in their relationship.</p><p id=eIX6qnTxASZ data-wc=30>Last month, she admitted she paid £10,000 for a plane to write “I Love You” across the sky for the funnyman in LA. “It was worth every penny,” she said.</p><p id=epXEQ0Rt26 data-wc=30>It seems the 25-year-old is just overjoyed to have found someone who’s a match for her.

So when someone really likes me, it's like here comes a person! I wonder if you can handle this," she said.</p><p id=eaqKMynsYY data-wc=53>"There's got to be respect. For me, that's hard because it's easy for me to steamroll guys. I need a man who tells me the party's over, that it's time to go home, because [we] have to work in the morning. I'm excited to find a partner who can just be my teammate.”</p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
