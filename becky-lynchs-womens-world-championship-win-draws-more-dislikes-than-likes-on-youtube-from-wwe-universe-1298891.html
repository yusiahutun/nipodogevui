This created a chance for other female wrestlers on the roster to step up and shine. To ensure fairness, a Battle Royal was organized to crown the new Women's World Champion. Despite facing tough competition, The Man emerged victorious by eliminating Liv Morgan last.</p><p>However, the result didn't seem to sit well with the majority of fans on social media platforms. <a href=# onclick='triggerArticleInterlinkClick("article_interlink_click","Becky Lynch&#39;s Women&#39;s World Championship Win Draws More Dislikes Than Likes On YouTube From WWE Universe","1298891","https://www.pinkvilla.com/sports/rhea-ripley-mocks-becky-lynch-after-the-man-captures-wwe-womens-world-heavyweight-championship-at-monday-night-raw-1298572","articlepage","/sports/becky-lynchs-womens-world-championship-win-draws-more-dislikes-than-likes-on-youtube-from-wwe-universe-1298891","Becky Lynch","Body_Hyperlink","sports","NA")'>Becky Lynch</a>'s Battle Royal victory video from WWE's official YouTube channel garnered more dislikes than likes, showing how fans were largely unhappy with the booking.
