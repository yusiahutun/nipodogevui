Since their launch in late 2021, they have had multiple replenishments and sales of thousands of units,” she says.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/04/03/e4288377-80ec-4c71-a520-24c88acd7c29_b2d88ba8.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Interestingly, Kermiche, who is a jewellery designer, never intended to create a line of ceramics. She made her first body-inspired jug for herself and it was only after years of friends and family begging her to produce more, that she launched a full-fledged line.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Topic class="css-1wyvcgo e1b1x8aa3"></span><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Title class="css-i31uou e1b1x8aa1">4 great last-minute gift ideas for the stylista in your life</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">It’s easy to see why they were a hit. Each of her creations glorifies the curves, lumps and bumps of women (notably celebrated in her cheekily named Breast Friend vase). Their body positive aesthetic and bold look have made them a winner among homeware fans looking to make a statement.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/04/03/dc6500a2-d404-4ff8-91c9-a995761710fc_d7491f3d.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Seattle-based Adrien Miller is another artist whose creations reimagine the human form. His full figure sculptures – some double as vases – often come with rainbow-coloured marbling for a bold look. His surrealist bowls with interior buffs are also a must-have, and include creations such as the Yin Yang lovers bowl: two faces on opposite sides, which symbolise their minds meeting in the middle as though they are in silent communication with each other.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Topic class="css-1wyvcgo e1b1x8aa3"></span><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Title class="css-i31uou e1b1x8aa1">Bespoke wallpaper: hand-painted home decor is the latest thing in luxury interiors</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">What ties many of these designers together is the fact that their creations blur the lines between art and function as seen in the work of pastry-chef-turned-artist Alma Berrow, who started spending time in her mother’s ceramic studio during the coronavirus lockdown.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/04/03/2daac0f8-2fa8-46a6-942d-f394809099e6_4541a64f.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Soon she was firing up everyday objects, which she would inject with her own twist of dark humour. Ashtrays come strewn with rotting lemons, discarded tea bags and used matches. Dirty plates are decorated with used Q-tips, fingernail clippings, half-used tubes of toothpaste and a condom wrapper. Even something as common as a backgammon board is littered with red and white pills while a Bible is covered in a white powdered substance that leaves plenty to the imagination.</p>“My primary muse is humanity and our intricate social connections, encapsulated in small moments immortalised through ceramics. While I embed my personal messages in my creations, what truly captivates me is the narratives others discover – rich tales of their own lives woven into the fabric of my work,” says Berrow, whose fans include <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">supermodel Kate Moss</span></a>.<img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/04/03/165fa077-dd53-44cd-89e5-37052fadac3e_530929fb.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Berrow says her creations navigate the delicate balance between light and dark, tapping into both the adult and inner child within everyone. “The allure is further enhanced by elements of nostalgia and storytelling woven into my work,” she says.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">French artist Laetitia Rouget is another talent whose objects come with their individual flair and personality. Her handmade candleholders, for example – each has its own unique character whether it be Eve, elephants, horses or even a female version of Santa Claus.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/04/03/e4405c53-118d-4516-9a57-9783617cb2a6_d7491f3d.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">It seems that the demand for ceramics isn’t going to wane any time soon. It’s become so popular that even luxury fashion brands such as Henry Holland, Bottega Veneta and Loewe have started to launch exclusive ceramic objects that are in keeping with their vision of promoting artisanal craftsmanship. Bottega Veneta, for example, has launched a series of decorative trays handmade from Venetian clay with an eye-catching volcanic glaze finish.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Topic class="css-1wyvcgo e1b1x8aa3"></span><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Title class="css-i31uou e1b1x8aa1">My Style: Heart Evangelista’s top 10 fashion tips and lifestyle hacks</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">With their remarkable blend of artistry and skill, there’s no doubt that many of these ceramic pieces will become as covetable as artworks in the future.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“The skill and craftsmanship involved in creating ceramic art are both important factors that can contribute to its investment value. Pieces that display exquisite technical skill and unique aesthetic are more likely to appreciate in the long run,” Page says.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kuqKzwLOgp52jZMC1xcueZqWhlprAtcXLnmaaqqSesK2xjmxpbm9nZn5ws8SnZLNlkaeybrDOp5xmoZuarm63zqiismWgpMG1sdGyZJqmlGK%2Fqr%2FQrpxmm5Wnrq61wqxkpaeVrLJurs6tq56fkWLDprrErZhmmZ6ZeqmxzauwZqCfobmiusNmo56Zng%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-is-joel-schiffman-todays-hoda-kotbs-ex-fiance.html><span>←</span><span>Who Is Joel Schiffman?
