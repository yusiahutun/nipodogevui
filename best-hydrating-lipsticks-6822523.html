Whether a tasteful nude or a bright poppy red, a swipe of lipstick instantly elevates any look from drab to fab, giving us the confidence to strut into our local bodega still in our pajamas feeling like a million bucks.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">But if you’ve always shunned lipstick for lip gloss or <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>lip balm</a>, we have news for you. The drying, cracking lipsticks of years past are long gone, and we’ve welcomed in a new generation of hydrating lipsticks that add color and moisture to your kisser.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">How are we so confident in this statement, you ask? Because we’ve done the homework. Over four months, we tested dozens of hydrating lippies to find the best lipsticks for nourished, plush lips. After carefully evaluating each option for longevity, color payoff, feel, and ingredients, these 12 lipsticks absolutely drench your lips in color and long-lasting hydration.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-overall-smashbox-be-legendary-prime--plush-lipstick></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Overall</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Smashbox Be Legendary Lipstick</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Smashbox Be Legendary Prime &amp;amp; Plush Lipstick" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/dXzKKtXdbiBd3bdm0Q12_zHc6S8=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/sephora-smashbox-be-legendary-lipstick-b8b4edfc79f94cc09ea57d2ded8f4257.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Sephora</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=-0.5><li readability=2><p>Though the formula is long-lasting, it isn’t transfer-proof, so we found ourselves reapplying after meals.</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">It’s rare to find a lipstick that provides bold color payoff, intense hydration, and longevity, but this pick from Smashbox holds the trifecta. Aptly named, the renowned two-in-one formula features a built in primer that ensures the lipstick applies like butter and enhances the color payoff for a vibrant finish. Beyond the primer, the creamy bullet is also infused with moisture-boosting peptides and ceramides that kept out lips feeling comfortable and supple throughout the day. (We didn’t have any urge to apply lip balm under or over it.)&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Satin lipsticks often get a reputation for fading quickly, but this pick's color remained intact and vibrant while testing. That said, even though the formula is long lasting, it wasn’t not totally transfer-proof — we found ourselves needing to reapply after eating. Because it’s so lightweight, though, we didn’t have to wipe it off and start over when touching up. We were able to fill in the sheer spots that had worn away without experiencing any annoying pilling, which frequently happens with some of our favorite non-hydrating lipsticks. Although we had never made it through a full tube of lipstick before, we used this until there was nothing left — a true testament to just how fortifying, beautiful, and comfortable it is.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">With 30 shades to choose from, we found options for any occasion, too. Some of our favorites include Level Up, a nude-pink for everyday looks, and Some Nerve, an electric purple, that’s a bit more adventurous.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Key Ingredients: </strong>Peptides and ceramides | <strong>Shades: </strong>30 | <strong>Finish: </strong>Satin</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-budget-loral-paris-glow-paradise-balm-in-lipstick></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Budget</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>L’Oréal Paris Glow Paradise Balm-in-Lipstick</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="L&amp;rsquo;Or&amp;eacute;al Paris Glow Paradise Balm-in-Lipstick" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/WopOwela5HdzA5MvDvUPcx2C5vQ=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/LOreal-Glow-Paradise-Balm-in-Lipstick-e2540900dcc74ff19018c0dc012009b9.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Ulta Beauty</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We carry lip balm with us everywhere, but sometimes we want a pop of color that most balms can’t provide — that’s where this lipstick comes in. Made with pomegranate extract, a single swipe of this lipstick-balm hybrid provides a much needed burst of hydration with gorgeous color payoff.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Contrary to run-of-the-mill lipsticks and balms, this one actually enhances lips with continued use: After using this for four weeks, our bare lips will feel smoother and softer. We appreciate that the gentle formula is also dermatologist and allergy-tested, making it suitable for sensitive lips. While there are 10 lustrous shades to choose from, the swatches shown on the brand’s site don’t accurately depict the lipstick colors, so we recommend watching <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nocaes>Allura Beauty’s YouTube video</a> of the swatches before making a final selection.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Key Ingredients: </strong>Pomegranate extract | <strong>Shades: </strong>10 | <strong>Finish: </strong>Luminous</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-splurge-sisley-paris-phyto-rouge-shine-refillable-lipstick></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Splurge</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Sisley Paris Phyto-Rouge Shine Refillable Lipstick</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Sisley Paris Phyto-Rouge Shine Refillable Lipstick" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/2LqSTg91ni91i7vmUH49j1m2Z8g=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Sisley-Phyto-Rouge-Shine-Refillable-Lipstick-eedf89e82dfd465fbf8d7b09506394c1.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Sisley</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We have a pretty extensive lipstick collection. In fact, if you take a peek in any of our purses, you’ll find a minimum of five lipsticks per bag. (What can we say? we like our options.) No matter where we are, though, we always find ourselves digging for this pick before anything else.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The luxurious formula features the brand’s unique Hydroboost complex, padina pavonica extract, and moringa oil to instantly nourish, plump, and moisturize. When applied, the lipstick beautifully melts into our lips, feeling like a buttery balm, and imparts a gorgeous, sheer pop of color with the shine of a lip gloss.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">When we want more color payoff, we can layer it on — we’ve been pleasantly surprised that an extra swipe (or two) leaves our lips feeling extra hydrated rather than uncomfortable and heavy. With 12 luminous colors to choose from, this pick has quickly replaced our tried-and-true balm — and our favorite lipstick — making it our most-used lip product. (There’s no doubt in my mind that you’ll feel the same way after trying it, too.) And when we inevitably finish the entire tube, we can purchase a refill at a lesser price and pop it into the cartridge we already have.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Key Ingredients: </strong>Hydrobooster complex, padina pavonica extract, vitamin E acetate | <strong>Shades: </strong>12 | <strong>Finish: </strong>Shiny and Iridescent</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-application-armani-beauty-lip-power-long-lasting-lipstick></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Application</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Armani Beauty Lip Power Long Lasting Lipstick</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Armani Beauty Lip Power Long Lasting Lipstick" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/i7qEw6HP7hCYh4yFUqSuoONrNy4=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/ArmaniBeautyLipPowerLongLastingLipstick-8dd0983c79354ac380f479c214f150d4.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Armani Beauty</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">When it comes to longwear formulations, satin lipsticks are often left out of the conversation — but Armani Beauty Lip Power is changing that narrative. Once applied, this highly pigmented lipstick stays put for up to eight hours, so as long as you’re not eating it will maintain vibrancy (although, we did go to town on some tacos while wearing this, and only had to reapply near the center of our lips).&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-21 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you do have to reapply, the teardrop-shaped bullet removes the need of a lip liner, as it precisely lines lips with minimal effort. On top of its impressive longevity, the formula is infused with special oils to keep lips feeling plush and smooth throughout the day.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">While there’s 26 shades currently available, Armani regularly adds new hues to the lineup. If you’re after a vivid lip color, this is the lipstick to grab, but be wary of the shades that lean neutral because we found that they’re more sheer than expected.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Key Ingredients: </strong>Semi volatile oil, satin finish oil | <strong>Shades: </strong>26 | <strong>Finish: </strong>Satin</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-gloss-tower-28-shineon-lip-jelly-non-sticky-gloss></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Gloss</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Tower 28 ShineOn Lip Jelly Non-Sticky Gloss</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Tower 28 ShineOn Lip Jelly Non-Sticky Gloss" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/KOcWhuM1m_ygYQdHzb6Y87IHMJQ=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/tower-28-shineon-lip-jelly-non-sticky-gloss-b35882ea651f46948fd12c1577407c07.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Tower 28</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=-0.5><li readability=2><p>Though there are 13 color options, the lighter shades don’t provide much pigment, especially for those with deeper skin tones.</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-27 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Erase the preconceived notion that all lip glosses are tacky — this one from Tower 28 proved to us that gloss can be silky and hydrating. The jelly-like formula glides onto our lips, covering them in a nourishing cocoon of five oils (apricot kernel, raspberry seed, rosehip, castor seed, and avocado oils), leaving them feeling soft and smooth, and looking brilliantly glazed. We’ve gone through multiple tubes of this gloss and consistently find ourselves reaching for it instead of lip balm to rejuvenate our lips.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Available in 10 sheer hues and two clear options (one that’s glassy and one that’s iridescent), each looks beautiful on its own or layered over lipstick. Though the gloss is sheer, we’d like the lighter shades to have a bit more pigment because they end up looking translucent on most skin tones, especially deeper ones.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-29 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Key Ingredients: </strong>Apricot kernel oil, raspberry seed oil, rosehip oil | <strong>Shades: </strong>13 | <strong>Finish: </strong>Glossy</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-longwear-kosas-weightless-lip-color-nourishing-satin-lipstick></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Longwear</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Kosas Weightless Lip Color Nourishing Satin Lipstick</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Kosas Weightless Lip Color Nourishing Satin Lipstick" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/vUep_JdaW8fX03aP3XYzgBb2VjY=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/kosas-weightless-lip-color-nourishing-satin-lipstick-0d536bf86f644b9ba9050e8b678e0a10.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Sephora</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-34 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">When we think of this lipstick, the first two words that come to mind are ‘melt’ and ‘longwear.’ We know what you’re thinking — these descriptors typically don’t go hand in hand (especially when it comes to makeup), but hear us out: The creamy bullet beautifully melts into our lips, saturating them with a longwear, rich pigment that truly lasts for hours. Infused with a slew of skin-softening ingredients (including mango seed butter, shea butter, and rosehip seed oil), this lippie cushions our lips with comfort, so they never feel parched or flakey.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-35 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Note that while it is long-wearing, the color does eventually fade. With that said, though, it does so evenly so we’re left with a natural-looking stain. Our one gripe is that the name is a bit misleading — the formula isn’t totally weightless: We can feel the nourishing ingredients working overtime to keep lips well moisturized.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-36 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Key Ingredients: </strong>Mango seed butter, shea butter, cocoa seed butter | <strong>Shades: </strong>11 | <strong>Finish: </strong>Satin</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-matte-sunnies-face-fluffmatte-weightless-modern-matte-lipstick></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Matte</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Sunnies Face Matte Lipstick</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Sunnies Face Fluffmatte Weightless Modern Matte Lipstick" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/oOspURoXSOEUZpUR2FtRm2zjC3Y=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Sunnies-Face-Fluffmatte-a7cc87e3027b4e78a49efb34644a33f3.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Sunnies Face</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-40 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Filipino brand Sunnies Face launched Fluffmatte in 2018, but it only debuted in the US last year — and now one is sold every 30 seconds. We’re rarely impressed by new lipsticks, but we can confidently say this is the best matte we've ever used.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-41 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Despite swiping on formulas that claimed to be hydrating, we always found ourselves reaching for a balm to revitalize our lips soon after application. That all changed when we tried this. The high-quality formula is unlike any matte lipstick currently available thanks to its silk structure technology that imparts a hint of hydration while making it feel like a weightless second skin on lips. Many matte lipsticks quickly settle into fine lines, but this one maintains a plush integrity, so the color stays looking fresh for hours, too. And though it may not be quite as hydrating as satin or balmy options, it sets the standard for what every matte lipstick should feel like.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-42 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Key Ingredients: </strong>Silk structure technology, dimethicone | <strong>Shades: </strong>24 | <strong>Finish: </strong>Matte</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-refillable-mob-beauty-cream-lipstick></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Refillable</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>MOB Beauty Cream Lipstick</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="MOB Beauty Cream Lipstick" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/Vg4xBELIA0WizIvmUUFe_040hgQ=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/MOB-Beauty-Cream-Lipstick-13d861e074b9493799f38bb9e764d9e5.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>MOB Beauty</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-46 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Listen, we know it’s a tough task, but finishing a full tube of lipstick isn’t impossible. If you find that you’re loyal to using one lip product until it’s fully gone, it could be a good idea to invest in a refillable option — and according to celebrity makeup artist <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nocaes>Mary Irwin</a>, MOB Beauty has the most lush refillable lipstick around. “The formula is vegan, and includes vitamin E, chamomile, and jojoba,” she explains.

Beyond being refillable, the cartridge is also completely recyclable, so if you ever decide you’re over this lipstick (we doubt that’ll happen) you can feel at ease knowing it will get another life. The only downfall of this pick is that it can melt if left out in the heat, so avoid keeping it in your car on hot days.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-48 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Though <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Sisley Paris Phyto-Rouge Shine</a> on our list is also refillable, this is a more economical option clocking in at less than half the price of the luxe pick’s original and the refill.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-49 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Key Ingredients: </strong>Chamomile, jojoba, and vitamin E | <strong>Shades: </strong>17 | <strong>Finish: </strong>Satin</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-vegan-saint-jane-luxury-lip-cream></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Vegan</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Saint Jane Luxury Lip Cream</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Saint Jane Luxury Lip Cream" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/tP4PjmbFYrF2ysPmsXaOJph7nOo=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/saint-jane-beauty-luxury-lip-cream-0799da41821e4c16ac82de7c98e9bf2e.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Neiman Marcus</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-52 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">When you think of lipstick, you may not consider it to be a skincare product — but that will change when you swipe on Saint Jane Luxury Lip Cream. A favorite of celebrity makeup artist <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nocaes>Renee Loiz</a>, this ultra-nourishing lip cream delivers rich, silky color, but its main selling point is how it makes lips feel, both immediately and over time.

Not only can these ingredients create a stinging sensation that’s plain uncomfortable, they can also be extremely drying. But hyaluronic acid actually acts as a natural plumping agent that also moisturizes — and it happens to be the star ingredient in this gentle yet effective formula from Tarte. We questioned why we put our lips through the pain of stinging glosses once we coated them with this pillowy, moisturizing lipstick-balm.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-59 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Along with hyaluronic acid, it’s jam-packed with over 10 superfruits (including maracuja oil, watermelon, strawberry, and peach to name a few), that are rich in antioxidants and aid in boosting hydration.

On those days, we find ourselves reaching for the Honest Beauty Lip Crayon. Available in seven velvety shades that complement all skin tones, this jumbo crayon has quickly become a staple for us. It contains a conditioning blend of shea butter, murumuru butter, and coconut oil that leaves our lips significantly softer in seconds. The oversized crayon allows us to easily fish it out of our purse in a pinch to achieve a perfect flush in a single swipe. While it does have an immediate moisturizing effect, it wears off pretty quickly, so you’ll have to reapply every few hours if your lips are prone to drying out, (like ours are).</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-64 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Key Ingredients:</strong> Shea butter, murumuru, and coconut oil | <strong>Shades: </strong>7 | <strong>Finish: </strong>Subtly shiny</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-multitasking-make-up-for-ever-rouge-artist-shine-on-lipstick></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Multitasking</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Make Up For Ever Rouge Artist Shine On Lipstick</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Make Up For Ever Rouge Artist Shine On Lipstick" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/pCeJz469KMwMSWTpWNSeMdkKJOo=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/makeupforever-d2859ef691fa472090e41c97e0ab8956.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Sephora</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-67 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">One trend that continues to stand the test of time is monochromatic makeup — and we understand why. The simplistic look can be completed with minimal effort, and only takes one product to master. Trust us when we say there’s no better thing to dust across your lips, cheeks, and eyes than Make Up For Ever Rouge Artist Shine On. The creamy, hyaluronic acid-infused formula beautifully blends into the skin when used on cheeks and eyes, but manages to pack a striking punch of color (and hydration) across the lips with a high shine that lasts for 12 hours. The packaging is also a work of art, but due to its sculpturesque nature, it gives the illusion that the bullet inside would be bigger, which is slightly disappointing.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-68 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Key Ingredients: </strong>Hyaluronic acid and red cranberries | <strong>Shades: </strong>21 | <strong>Finish: </strong>Satin-shine</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-our-testing-process></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Our Testing Process</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">After researching the most popular hydrating lipsticks and asking makeup artists for their tried-and-true favorites, we put more than 30 formulas to the test over a three month period to see which ones keep lips moisturized and comfortable.

Looking at the ingredients will be a good indicator as to whether or not your lipstick will be moisturizing. Loiz recommends looking for formulas that contain butters, oils, or waxes — these ingredients will help keep your lips well-hydrated. Hyaluronic acid, ceramides, and peptides are also powerhouse hydrators.&nbsp;</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>How can you keep your lips hydrated while wearing lipstick?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Ensuring your lips stay hydrated while wearing lipstick starts in the prep. Remember: Your lips are a part of your skin, so you should care for them just like you would the rest of your body, says <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nocaes>Eddie Duyos</a>, professional makeup artist and Senior Manager of Pro Education & Artistry for Make Up For Ever. Before applying your lipstick, “apply a thin layer of your favorite lip balm or salve, then lightly blot the excess,” he explains. This hydrating layer will prevent dryness and flakes and offers an extra layer of hydration when wearing a moisturizing lipstick. Before bed, you can apply a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>lip mask</a> to lock in essential moisture, too.&nbsp;</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Can you keep your lips moisturized when wearing matte lipstick?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">While some matte formulas can be hydrating (like <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="nofollow nocaes">Sunnies Face Fluffmatte</a>) mattes are notoriously drying. To make sure your lips stay comfortable and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>smooth while wearing matte lipstick</a>, you’ll want to adequately prep them. Irwin suggests using a scrub beforehand because “matte formulas tend to enhance dry skin.” After the scrub, let either a super moisturizing lip balm or lip mask sit on your lips for 10-15 minutes. Then, wipe off the excess before applying the matte lipstick. “Doing this will always give you a beautiful end result, and your lips won’t feel dried out or uncomfortable later,” says Duyos.&nbsp;</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-why-trust-instyle></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Why Trust InStyle?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-21 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Mary Honkus</a> is a Beauty Commerce Editor at InStyle with over four years of experience covering makeup, skincare, and hair care.
