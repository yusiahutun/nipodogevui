The Freemasons are one of the oldest charitable organisations in the <a href=#>world</a>. The fraternal organisation abides by centuries-old traditions, and its members include prominent people in society. Although the organisation's foundation is in Europe, the Masons have expanded their reach to other parts of the world, including Kenya. The Freemasons in Kenya aren't outspoken, and their presence in the country is spoken of in harsh tones. So, what makes them appear secretive?</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/8558c108321956f1.jpeg><p class=align-left>The Freemasons have a long and complex history. Their rites and practices appear strange and cultish to the outside world. Perhaps the organisation's reluctance to open up to the world about their rituals makes them suspect. Popular movies and books haven't helped either, as they have fostered even more sinister misconceptions. But are the stories true?</p><h2>Who are the Freemasons?</h2><p class=align-left>The Freemasons' society has always been mysterious, with outsiders hardly knowing what it is about. Freemasonry is a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">fraternal organisation</a> consisting of men from all walks of life, <a href=#>many religions </a>and backgrounds. The society brings together men of good character who believe in God's fatherhood and humanity's brotherhood.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/b41046707bb6299f.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>15 famous buildings in Africa that showcase the continent's iconic architecture</span></p></a><p class=align-left>According to the United Grand Lodge of England, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">worldwide membership </a>stands at around 6 million, with 1.1 million in North America. Kenya's membership isn't known as it is only recently that people have started demystifying the society.</p><h2>When did Freemasonry start?</h2><p class=align-left>It is unclear when exactly the secret society started, as its origins are obscure, and the matter is rife with myth and speculation. However, it is known that modern Freemasonry started in England in 1717.</p><p class=align-left>Some claim that the Freemasons are descended from the builders of Solomon's Temples (known as the First Temple) in Jerusalem. Other sources state that the organisation started as an offshoot of the Knights Templars, a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Catholic military order</a> from medieval times.</p><p class=align-left>Interestingly, there have been claims that the Freemasons are the same as Illuminati, an 18th secret society that started in Germany. All these myths and theories have been debunked, but some still abide by them.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/4ccb42c42974bdcc.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>The top 15 biggest gangs in the world by population</span></p></a><p class=align-left>The Freemason’s most concrete origin can be traced to the stonemason guilds of medieval Europe. These guilds were responsible for building some of the best establishments in the 14th century, like the ornate Gothic cathedrals of Notre Dame in Paris and Westminster Abbey in London.</p><p class=align-left>The guild members guarded their secrets, which could only be passed down to other members considered worthy. Not everyone was accepted as a member, and the successful ones underwent a rigorous induction process, during which they learnt the craft.</p><p class=align-left>Unfortunately, the guild system broke down during the 16th and 17th centuries, but the masonic lodges remained. And to raise money, the stonemason guilds started recruiting non-masons. Over time, the list of recruits included the wealthy people in society, who recruited others, and the organisation grew beyond Europe.</p><p class=align-left>Today, Freemasonry has grown out of the old and restrictive membership traditions of the 14th century, with masonic lodges scattered throughout the world. The association still shares the system of secrecy, ritual, and growth, but the work has shifted from building edifices to building oneself in good character.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/2453fb01f94bdc72.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>The Whittaker inbred family story: Everything you should know</span></p></a><h2>How to join Freemasons</h2><p class=align-left>Are you interested in becoming a Freemason? One must seek admission based on his own free will and accord. This means that they must ask an existing member to <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">sponsor their application</a>.</p><p class=align-left>The joining process is managed at the Lodge level, and the first step is to get in touch with the Lodge that you would like to consider your membership application.</p><p class=align-left>If your <a href=#>application is successful</a>, you will be invited for an interview where a few things will be discussed. The secret organisation is concerned about your <a href=#>family</a> and what they will think about you once you become a member because of the negative views about Freemasons.</p><p class=align-left>Your application is then announced to seek objection; if there is none, you are welcomed and shown what it is all about. New members are initiated through rituals.</p><p class=align-left>It is important to note that membership is open to people from all backgrounds and the organisation's primary intent is to empower people to be the best they can be.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/d3b81733363041d3.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>10 most beautiful Iranian women you should definitely know about</span></p></a><h2>Who are the Freemason members in Nairobi?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/b41046707bb6299f.jpeg><p class=align-left>Considering it is a secret society, you wouldn't expect to find a list of members. Therefore, associates of the Freemason secret organisation in <a href=# rel=noopener>Kenya</a> are hardly known. However, lawyer Ambrose Rachier has publicly stated his membership to the Freemasons in Kenya.</p><p class=align-left>He did this during an interview with <a href=# rel=noopener>NTV Kenya</a>, where he debunked myths about the secret organisation, mostly negative ones. During the interview, Ambrose stated the secret society in Kenya has a few <a href=#>wealthy individuals</a> and others who live ordinary lives. Ambrose also mentioned that some of the members of the Freemasons in Kenya are judges of the court.</p><h2>Where is the Freemasons Hall in Nairobi?</h2><p class=align-left>The Freemasons Hall in Nairobi is located along Nyerere Road. In the East Africa region, there are around 48 lodges, out of which 34 are in Kenya. These are scattered throughout the country, including Nakuru, Ruiru, Naivasha, Eldoret, Kitale, Kericho, Kisumu, Nyeri, and Mombasa.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/163b08d551ccbcd2.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>The 10 most conservative countries in the world in 2021</span></p></a><h2>Advantages of being a Freemason</h2><p class=align-left>Many people in Kenya have been interested in Freemasonry for the alluded perks that aren't even verified. It is still unknown if members joining the society are assured of immense wealth as people outside the society assume.</p><p class=align-left>The Freemasons have always stated that their primary intent is to support one another, build strong relationships, and donate to charity, among many others. So, is there a way that one would benefit once they join the secret organisation?</p><p class=align-left>Of course, there are perks to <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">becoming a Freemason</a>. One of the greatest things is that it is a global society. Therefore, you can travel across the nation and the world and meet other Freemasons.</p><p class=align-left>Once you become a member of the Freemasons society, you will gain access to intellectual discussions and talks that will be helpful to your personal development. Another great gain is that Freemasons encourage interaction with diverse groups of people, giving you a chance to explore different aspects of life.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/f224c47f273a3ecc.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>15 most famous BWWM couples who are cute together</span></p></a><h2>What are the disadvantages of being a Freemason?</h2><p class=align-left>The common perception is that Freemasonry is great. However, like everything else, there must be some negatives. The most outspoken when you join is the time factor.</p><p class=align-left>Freemasons require members to meet regularly, which might be a problem if you have other matters to attend to. Money might be a problem as the secret organisation prides itself on contributing to charitable organisations. So, you might struggle with this on top of the annual dues of being a member if you are not financially stable.</p><p class=align-left>Finally, there's the negative image of the secret organisation that doesn't seem to go away. People regard members of the Freemasons as evil because of the human sacrifice myth. So, you will always be haunted by such an image if you become a member.</p><h2>Quick facts about the Freemasons in Kenya</h2><li>Who is the head of the Masons?
