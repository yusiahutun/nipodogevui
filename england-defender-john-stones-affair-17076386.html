And she said his deceit left her sick.</p><p>Jessica said: “I definitely had feelings for him. It felt like we were connecting, speaking constantly and sharing everyday life.</p><p>“We spoke twice a day, every single day. We saw each other once a week at least since we met. That was how intense it was.”</p><p>She often stayed with Stones at the Lowry, where he kept a suite after signing for City in August.</p><p>They enjoyed nights out with his teammates and Jessica’s girlfriends at Manchester’s Club Liv where they danced together and kissed openly. They also visited the VIP area at Manchester235 Casino and enjoyed dates at the city’s All Star Lanes bowling club.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article15677317.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_John-Stones-Jessica-Peaty-romance-728954> <a class=gallery-interaction href=# data-link-tracking=inArticle|slideshow><span>The most expensive central defenders of all time</span> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article20453779.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/0_608187> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article15116281.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_John-Stones-Jessica-Peaty-Millie-Savage-romance-728900> <span class=label>View gallery</span></a><p>Jessica was convinced the relationship was becoming serious and they slept together two weeks after meeting.</p><p>She said: “I wanted to keep my head screwed on about the whole thing because I didn’t want it to get to a point where I was being naive.</p><p>“He was always really, really concerned about how I was feeling. Which made me think that he must care.”</p><p>The pair met on August 4 at Victor’s restaurant in the posh Cheshire village of Hale. Stones approached Jessica’s table after they shared glances across the room.</p><p>They swapped numbers and he texted her the next morning.</p><p>Their relationship quickly developed and they had their first date five days later – the day after he joined City in a £47.5million move from Everton.</p><p>Jessica, 20, didn’t realise her new man was a household name until she saw his face in the newspapers. When she asked him why he had kept quiet, he said he liked being treated like a normal person.</p><p>They shared their first kiss at Jessica’s house after she cooked him steak and vegetables – he even helped her to wash up the dishes.</p><p>Jessica said: “We kissed at the end of the night, it was building up to it, we were watching the film and cuddling.</p><p>“After that we’d speak every day on the phone, and on the coach to the ground to away games and on the runway in planes. He was really keen, but he was really, really bad over text so if I didn’t reply he’d ring me straight away.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article15105717.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_John-Stones-Jessica-Peaty-romance-728957><p>Whenever Stones was training for City and England, the pair would share photos of what they were up to. He often called her “babe” and Jessica sent photos of herself decorating at home, in her bikini on holiday and enjoying nights out with friends</p><p>He shared a video of himself dancing and a saucy snap in his pants as he rested with a muscle training pad on his thigh.</p><p>Their text messages also included cheeky references to their time together.</p><p>In one exchange Jessica asked if his flight had left yet.</p><p>But things started to go wrong when Jessica learned of Stones’ long-term girlfriend Millie.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>She spotted an online snap of them out shopping.</p><p>And she also heard him taking a phone call in her hallway which he ended by telling the person on the other end: “I love you too.”</p><p>Stones said the call was from his mum and claimed he was just friends with Millie.</p><p>Jessica said: “I’m not a stupid person, but he made me feel guilty for asking the question. He was like, ‘Oh you should know that I really like you, I wouldn’t be here if I didn’t’. He was like, ‘I’ve been speaking to you so much’. Stuff like that.”</p><p>Then in late September Stones showed off his Champions League team kit, including his new boots – emblazoned with a tribute to Millie. It read “Pencil Savage” – a combination of his nickname and Millie’s surname. Stones laughed off Jessica’s fears and said he simply hadn’t had time to get it removed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>But Jessica decided to approach a mutual friend for answers – and they confirmed Stones was “110% still with Millie”.</p><p>She said the news made her feel sick.</p><p>Jessica said: “My heart just sank, it was awful, it was just absolutely awful. Even though I had this gut feeling that something wasn’t right, it was the confirmation.</p><p>“Everything that he’d ever said to me, everything that we’d ever done up until that point, I was like, why have you put us both in this situation?</p><p>“It was completely unnecessary. He’d go out of his way to make plans – for him to put so much effort in when he’s got a girlfriend? I couldn’t get my head round it.</p><p>“I had the worst anxiety, I felt sick, it was horrible. He made me ill. At the end of the day, I wasn’t eating.” The next day, she quizzed Stones and refused to accept his claims that he hadn’t had any contact with Millie since June.</p><p>She said: “He was trying to come up with every excuse under the sun as to why he’d still be in contact with her, and that if I contacted her I would look like I was crazy.</p><p>“He was making me feel like a psychopath. I told him, ‘You’re the worst type of person because you said not to put you in the same boat as everyone else, and you’re ten times worse’. And I said, ‘I know for a fact that you’re lying to me. So either way whether you admit it or not, I don’t want to speak to you again’.”</p><p>Jessica left the country on a planned holiday to Florida with her friends.</p><p>She also decided to send a message to Millie.</p><p>After finding her on Instagram, Jessica wrote: “I’m really sorry to have to get in touch with you like this as I assume you will have no idea who I am.</p><p>“I have been seeing John for the last few months and need to know whether you are or have been together during that time. If that’s the case I won’t have any further contact with him. I’m only asking because I have heard things from other people and John has denied that he has anything to do with you since June. But the only way I could really find out is through you.”</p><p>The next day – as Stones appeared on TV at a press conference ahead of England’s game with Malta on October 8 – Jessica says Millie rang her and the women chatted.</p><p>Jessica told us: “I do feel bad for Millie, it’s an awful situation to be in, but I can’t have sympathy for her if she chooses to stay with him.</p><p>“I hate that he’s got this whiter-than-white reputation and everyone thinks that the sun shines out of his a***.”</p><p>She added: “I do miss him. It’s like he’s died, it’s awful. To be speaking to someone constantly and to be sharing your everyday life with them, then nothing. But I would never go back out of principle, I wouldn’t do it to myself.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pa3IpbCsrJGne6S7ja6iaKaVrMBwuMCtnKysXaOyuL%2BOnqWgpJGjsW6wxJ%2Bcp5yVp3qru8enZKysn6OytHnAn52aoaJifnh8lm9qcW4%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./juan-fernandez.html><span>←</span><span>Who is Juan Fernndez dating?
