Well, it kind of is.</p><p>This week's episode of <a href=#>Dutton Rules</a>&nbsp;finds hosts Adison Haager and Billy Dukes exploring why it's a&nbsp;big deal. A reader version is also below.</p><p>During <a href=#>Ep. 7 of Season 5 of Yellowstone</a>, John Dutton (<a href=#>Kevin Costner)</a> learns of a brucellosis contamination that's going to require drastic action. He goes to throw a whiskey glass, but Beth stops him, reminding him that those belonged to his grandfather.</p><p>Those glasses and the glasses that Spencer and Alex are sipping from during 1923 appear to be the same glasses!</p><p>This is meaningful because the common thinking was Costner's John Dutton extended from Jack Dutton, played by Darren Mann on 1923. This allows him to be a "fifth generation farmer" (as introduced by Jamie Dutton during his&nbsp;gubernatorial inauguration) and allows for Tate Dutton to be the seventh generation Dutton the Crow elder tabbed as the one who'd need to give back the land.</p><figure class="img-tag has-sizer aligncenter"><p><span class=visually-hidden>TasteofCountry</span></p>TasteofCountry<p>loading...</p></figure><p>If Spencer is John's grandfather, then all of this moves up a generation. John Dutton Sr. (played by Dabney Coleman) becomes a cousin to Jack Dutton, and the three Dutton kids (Lee, Beth, Kayce) move up a line, as well.</p><p>This makes Tate Dutton a sixth generation Dutton, not seventh, so perhaps after creator Taylor Sheridan is done with all of his prequels, he'll add a&nbsp;show set in year 2063!</p><a class="next-post cto" href=#>Next: Remaining Yellowstone and 1923 Schedule Confirmed</a><p>Thank you so much for listening.
