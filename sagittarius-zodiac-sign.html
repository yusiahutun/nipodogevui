Spanning most of the official holiday season, one of the most jubilant, magical, and playful times of the year comes to us courtesy of Sag, a fire sign associated with a love of life,&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>over-the-top self-expression</a>, adventure, learning, zest for philosophizing, positive outlook, seemingly organic fortune, and direct opinions. These traits are owed to Sagittarius' ruling planet Jupiter — a benefic, or "good-doer," planet that oversees fortune, expansion, optimism, and big-picture thinking. Sags are astrologically wired to go big or go home artistically and make their mark by making their uniquely entertaining voices heard dynamically.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Here's everything you need to know about the entertaining, unfiltered fire sign.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-sagittarius-personality-traits></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Sagittarius Personality Traits</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_6-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>The Spirited Explorer of the Zodiac</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Those born between November 22 and December 21 can generally assume their sun sign is Sagittarius. (It's not definitive because the sun moves between signs on different days annually.) Also, note that while we typically refer to ourselves as our sun sign, it's just one detail of a&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>natal chart</a>, which is basically a unique snapshot of the sky when you were born. However, it's a detail that helps color your core sense of self, identity, personal style, self-esteem, and confidence.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Typical sun in Sag traits include harboring an insatiable wanderlust that ideally results in&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>globetrotting adventures</a>&nbsp;and lifelong learning about cultures apart from their own; an inner compass that guides them to seek truth and stand up for what they believe is right, speaking their mind no matter what (often seemingly without running it through any diplomacy filter before blurting it out); being able to step into the spotlight with ease and entertain crowds; a love of bold art and creative expression; and a natural exuberance and spiritedness that makes them the life of any party.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">These characteristics reflect themes covered by the Ninth House of Adventure and Higher Learning, which Sagittarius rules. The Ninth House covers how you work to broaden your horizons, seek out new, eye-opening experiences, take risks, and pursue personal growth. It also deals with long-distance/international travel, politics, religion, morals, ethics, and high-minded conversation.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>The Mutable Fire Sign</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Every sign is assigned a quality (cardinal, mutable, or fixed), which explains the sign's basic energy. Every element has a cardinal, mutable, and fixed sign (fire, earth, air, water). Sag is the mutable one of the fire group, meaning they are flexible, open to going with the flow, and typically willing to hear all sides of an issue before making a decision, much like&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Virgo</a>&nbsp;(earth), as well as&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Gemini</a>&nbsp;(air) and Pisces (water).</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Sagittarius' Best Personality Traits</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_19-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Philosophical, curious, fun-loving, and determined to take life, love, and the world by storm, soaking up knowledge at every turn, you can be sure that the Sagittarians in your life will motivate you to get off the couch and embrace a YOLO-esque perspective. They are the multi-hyphenate entertainers of the zodiac, gifted and interested in everything from comedy to acting to songwriting. They generally strike those around them as gregarious, lively, and dynamic, but, like everyone else, they have their dark moments. They just tend to cope by channeling their pain into their art.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_21-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">They're infatuated with soaking up all their knowledge, especially about other cultures, distant travel destinations, politics, and social justice. They were born with a naturally passionate, fiery voice that they often want to lend to causes that inspire and drive them. If you're dating a Sagittarius, they'll be unabashedly direct about their feelings, as this is one sign that finds pretty much zero value in playing games or beating around the bush.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_25-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Sagittarius' Worst Personality Traits</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_26-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The mutable fire sign's ability to cut through BS and tell it like it is can be refreshing in some contexts — or downright cringe-worthy in others. Circumstances that might call for a certain amount of diplomacy or delicate action aren't exactly Sag's forte. Because expansive, magnifying Jupiter is the planetary force informing their M.O., they tend to go overboard in just about any instance, be it running up credit card debt or filling their calendar up with a few too many happy hours or nights out. Because they despise monotony, they might take risks that feel thrilling but are reckless. The key is for them to channel that desire for fire and wonder into their favorite creative art form or big-picture conversations and brainstorms.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-sagittarians-in-love-and-lust></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_28-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Sagittarians in Love and Lust</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_29-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Sagittarius' Romance Style</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_30-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">If your date adores no-holds-barred humor, exotic foods, flights to far-off destinations, adventurous outings (like hitting a hiking trail or going horseback riding), chances are you're seeing someone born under the influence of wanderlust-filled Sagittarian energy. The fire sign is a direct, bold, fiery, passionate force to be reckoned with, which is ideal for anyone who dreams of an adventurous, perhaps even globetrotting affair.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_32-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Interested in connecting with a Sag in a lasting way? You might need thick skin, as their tendency to embrace a direct, unfiltered communication style can come off as brash and, at worst, insensitive. On the other hand, they're lively, enthusiastic, and often brimming with an exuberance that can be downright infectious and thrilling. Loving a Sag means being up for their adoration of always learning, growing, and exploring in many ways — quite often through experiences and fiery conversation.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_36-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Sagittarius' Sexual Style</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_37-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Sag's go-getter spirit absolutely shows up in the bedroom. And given their associations with the Ninth House of Adventure and Higher Learning and Jupiter, the lucky planet that brings an amplifying effect to everything it touches, Sagittarians crave sexual experiences that will broaden their horizons and allow them to be unabashedly themselves. This could mean taking sex workshops with their partner to explore a fetish or even flirting with exhibitionism while on a camping trip. They'll also be the first in the zodiac to find out about a sexy trend happening in Singapore or Reykjavík that they'll then want to learn about and experiment with. Given their open-minded, independent point of view, they would certainly be open to unconventional arrangements, like an open relationship.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_39-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Given the influence of "go-big-or-go-home" Jupiter, facing nothing more than a&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>missionary, vanilla experience</a>&nbsp;might bore a Sag into feeling turned off entirely. They would prefer that every part of sex contributes to making them feel more alive — physically, mentally, and emotionally. Cue the lively, passionate debate, which might even border on outright head-butting as foreplay. With their penchant for blurting out their inner thoughts whenever they feel like it, they might also be particularly vocal in the midst of the act, offering up raunchy dirty talk. Speaking of dirty, Sag is also not one to shy away from making a mess (think: body painting or lots of lube).</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-sagittarius-compatibility></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_43-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Sagittarius Compatibility</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_44-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Wondering how Sag matches up with your sign as a friend, a lover, a colleague, or in terms of any other one-on-one relationship? Below, their most harmonious partners, as well as conflict-triggering pairings:</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_46-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Most Compatible Signs</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_47-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Signs that share the same element tend to be the most in sync (e.g., two air signs, like&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Libra</a>&nbsp;and Gemini). In the case of one fire sign with the other, it can really go to one extreme or the other. Either you'll feel like your companionship breeds mutual passion, creativity, playfulness, and excitement, or you could be prone to hotheaded blow-ups, drama, and incessant conflict. Fire is also traditionally compatible with air, as the two elements share certain attributes, like being free-spirited, independent, speedy, and social.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_49-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">That said, a Sag often hits it off with a similarly buoyant&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Leo</a>, go-getter Aries, or free-spirited&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Aquarius</a>.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_51-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Least Compatible Signs</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_52-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Opposites can definitely attract — and that's often the case with Sag and Gemini. Both are lifelong learners who love to express themselves and share ideas with others. But Gemini's energy tends to be more light and curious, while Sag has an&nbsp;agenda, and in the end, this could cause them to feel out of sync with one another.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_54-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Sag and empathetic water sign Pisces are square (the most challenging aspect that can exist between two signs). This is also the case for Sag and the sensitive earth sign Virgo. Sag respects other mutable signs' ability to switch up their approach based on the way the wind is blowing. Still, emotionally, they're too changeable to solidify a connection unless they share other harmonious aspects in their natal charts.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-sagittarius-elsewhere-in-your-chart></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_58-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Sagittarius Elsewhere in Your Chart</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_59-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">As mentioned previously, the sun sign is one of many aspects of a natal chart. When you were born, the moon and all the planets in our solar system were in one of the 12 signs and a particular position — all of which help to inform your personality and areas of your life. Here's what it means if Sagittarius shows up in any of the main areas of your chart:</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_61-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Sagittarius Moon</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_62-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The moon, which spends about two to three days in each sign, influences your emotions and intuition. If it was in Sag at the time of your birth, you feel compelled to be direct, unfiltered, and unapologetically genuine regarding matters of the heart. Mind games or superficiality make you want to jump out of your skin.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_64-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Sagittarius Mercury</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_65-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Mercury, which spends about two to three weeks in a sign, shapes your communication style. If it was in Sag when you were born, your appetite for knowledge is downright insatiable, and you speak directly from your heart. You're straightforward, optimistic, big picture-oriented, and seek out fiery, philosophical debate as a way to connect with others.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_69-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Sagittarius Venus</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_70-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Venus, which remains a sign for about three to five weeks, influences how you behave in relationships and attract others. If you were born with the planet of love and beauty in Sag, you want to feel like your closest relationships will help you broaden your horizons and see the world in a new, transformative, educational way. Experiential dates — like attending an immersive art exhibit or taking an impromptu road trip — are your jam.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_72-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Sagittarius Mars</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_73-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Mars</a>, which remains in a sign for six or seven weeks, affects your energy, strength, sexual style, and how you experience courage. If you were born while the fiery, dynamic, fighter planet was in mutable, fiery Sag, you won't shy away from going after whatever you want, be it a new job or love affair. They're playful, persuasive, blunt lovers of life who act and then think.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_75-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Sagittarius Ascendant (or Rising)</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_76-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Your ascendant or <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>rising sign</a> influences how you present yourself to the world. As a Sagittarius ascendant, you come off as dynamic, magnetic, exciting, funny, and exuberant about life, love, and everything the world offers.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57y6Kdnqukrrmme9KanqKspJa%2FqsHSZrGonJmWsG6%2FyKCl</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./reena-sky-biography-age-images-height-net-worth-tellygupshup.html><span>←</span><span>Reena Sky Biography, Age, Images, Height, Net Worth Tellygupshup</span></a>
