Eventually, Daenerys begins to destroy the Red Keep, the castle built by her ancestors to house the ruler of the Seven Kingdoms.<br></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=1 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Much of the Red Keep falls, including a grand staircase, the cellar through which <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/culture/film-tv/a27448043/game-of-thrones-cersei-death-twitter-reactions/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Jaime and Cersei try to escape" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Jaime and Cersei try to escape</a>, and the courtyard that housed the famed painted map of Westeros. But there’s one thing the episode doesn't show at all: the Iron Throne. Does it even even exist anymore? Did Daenerys destroy her life goal while seeking revenge on the innocent? Probably not. Despite her rampage of horror, the Iron Throne is likely still standing—for now.</p><img alt="Poster, Fictional character, Graphic design, Darkness, Album cover, Book cover, Movie, Cg artwork, " title="Poster, Fictional character, Graphic design, Darkness, Album cover, Book cover, Movie, Cg artwork, " width=980 height=1470 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/5c-1558029714.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">HBO</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=3 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The Iron Throne is the driving force of the show and Daenerys's role on it, so if it did get destroyed, we would've seen it onscreen. Plus, the Iron Throne is likely still intact thanks to a scene from Season 2 Episode 10, "Valar Morghulis."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In the House of the Undying in Qarth, Daenerys has a vision of herself walking into the empty throne room in the Red Keep. The roof is gone, and the room is covered in what appears to be snow (in hindsight, it's probably ash from Drogon's attack). In her vision, Daenerys gets within an arm’s reach of the Iron Throne, but never gets to touch it. We’ll probably see a very similar scene in the final episode, with Daenerys thinking she’s finally succeeded. But no matter what happens in the Game of Thrones finale, one thing is almost certain: The Iron Throne, like many characters on Game of Thrones, is likely not long for this world.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The show has always focused on characters trying to rebuild Westeros, to “break the wheel” by making it a better, safer place. In Westeros history, many people have tried to do this, but all failed, from the best of the Targaryens (like Daenerys’s own brother Rhaegar), to Robert Baratheon and even Tommen. The problem has and always will be the Iron Throne. It is a symbol of violence and intimidation, of fire and blood, and as long as it exists, everyone in Westeros will live in fear of it—no matter who sits on it.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">There will be a leader by the end of the show (please <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/culture/film-tv/a27448097/sansa-stark-game-of-thrones/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="let it be Sansa" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">let it be Sansa</a>), surrounded by wise counsel (Davos, Bran, and Tyrion if he doesn’t die). But the Iron Throne will likely be destroyed before they sit on it, marking the end of the throne and the dangerous game people played to secure it.</p><span class="css-1s9owpq ev8dhu51"><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/a22549cf-68b2-47e5-95e6-bd61dd2c8efb_1616511347.png alt="Headshot of Carrie Wittmer" title="Headshot of Carrie Wittmer" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Carrie is a Brooklyn-based entertainment journalist and critic with bylines in GQ, The Ringer, Vulture, The Cut, and more.
