<span>Larita Shotwell</span></p><h1>Tatum O'Neal Wishes 'Things Could Be Different' With Her Dad Ryan</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>Just days after <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Tatum O’Neal</strong></a> took to Instagram to share a photo of herself sitting with her famous father, <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Ryan O’Neal</strong></a>, at a doctor’s office while the 77-year-old actor was&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener>“trying to get his heart fixed up,”</a>&nbsp;the star returned to the social media outlet on Valentine’s Day to pen a sweet note to her dad.</p><p>“Dear Daddy, Happy St. Valentine’s Day!&nbsp;I found a picture of us in better times. I want to tell you that I am me because of you, and I mean all my good qualities,”&nbsp;the&nbsp;Paper Moon&nbsp;actress, 55, captioned <a href=#>a throwback&nbsp;photo of herself and Ryan</a> smiling and laughing while sitting side-by-side. “The way I have taught my children the joy of irony and how to love. The ability to laugh ourselves. Love of movies. I wish things could be different that I could have made choices you could be more proud of. I have to live with myself and take pride in the woman I am today for better or worse.”&nbsp;<strong>Check out Tatum’s V-Day post to Ryan below!</strong></p><p>Tatum added, “All I wanted, was for you to feel my love for you and know there is no preexisting reasons except that I love you!! Just know that! Baby Mozart at your feet. Love your daughter.”</p><p>The two had previously been estranged for 20 years, but it seems they are working to patch things up today. During an <a href=#>exclusive 2018 interview&nbsp;with Closer Weekly</a>, Tatum&nbsp;revealed,&nbsp;“I think he’s still really mad at me, as well — I’m not quite sure why. Some people just stay mad and all you can do is try to take care of your side of the street.” Thankfully, it seems the father-daughter duo’s relationship has some a long way since then.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Tatum-Oneal-Ryan-Oneal.jpg><p>In addition to being known for&nbsp;Paper Moon&nbsp;—&nbsp;which she starred in with her father — Tatum is also known for her role in&nbsp;The Bad News Bears. Ryan’s most famous film is&nbsp;Love Story and he was later honored with the <a href=#>Best Actor Oscar</a> in 1970 for his performance.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46tmK2tnWK8r7HApWSwoaOdsrR506Ggp5%2BjYrCwwcudZJudXZm2p7LEq5ynrF2strW0jKGcq2WUlrFuvtiapWg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./meaning-of-ferris-wheel-by-imagine-dragons.html><span>←</span><span>Meaning of Ferris wheel by Imagine Dragons</span></a>
