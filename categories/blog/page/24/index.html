An NYPD doctor rushed a cop back to full duties after he suffered a heart attack and a stroke, forcing him to leave his job, according to a bombshell new lawsuit.
The department's Dr. John Santucci allegedly told former officer Girard Moscato, 57, that he did 'not care' about his cardiologist's recommendation to work part-time after suffering two serious health failings the year before.&nbsp;
Moscato said COVID complications caused him to suffer a heart attack and a stroke in February 2021, and he was still feeling the effects the following year.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Bobby George explains perfect nine-darter with unique scoring combination</h2><time>Aug 27, 2024</time>

Every nine-dart finish is perfect, right? Well, not according to darts maverick Bobby George.
The 2023 World Darts Championship has had pretty much everything. Almost. Ahead of the final between Michael van Gerwen and Michael Smith, fans are still waiting for the first nine-darter of the tournament.
There were three at Alexandra Palace last year while there were numerous single-figure legs over the course of 2022. But despite a few near misses, fans have disappointingly missed out on the crowd carnage that only a nine-darter brings.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Lady Gaga &amp;amp; BLACKPINK 'Sour Candy' Lyrics Meaning in English</h2><time>Aug 27, 2024</time>

Los árbitros no hablan nunca, pero deberían. Sobre todo en jugadas como ésta. ¿Por qué Gil Manzano pitó el final del partido cuando Brahim golpeó el balón para poner el centro? Pudo hacerlo antes, como había anunciado, en cuanto el Valencia despejó el córner, pero esperó a que el jugador del Real Madrid pusiera el balón al corazón del área. Incomprensible. Una acción inédita y con la que privó al Madrid de firmar la remontada.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Top 15 Magician Movies of all time: From Houdini to The Illusionist</h2><time>Aug 27, 2024</time>
