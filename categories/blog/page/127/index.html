“Many offered constructive advice to Ma when he ran for president [in 2008], but after he took office, it seemed he was busy with his administration and stopped short of correcting the misconceptions of the previous years … Many people asked him to reset the guideline changes, but he appeared indifferent,” Su wrote.
Su also said that despite his gentlemanly image, Ma’s “reluctance to take note of his fundamental support base” had caused “grumbles from people on his side”.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Henderson County Sheriff investigates death</h2><time>Mar 10, 2024</time>

Lauren Mascitti has a rising career in country music after her stint on American Idol, but she's been focusing quite a bit of her attention elsewhere recently. The "Losing My Mind" singer also works as a registered nurse in Nashville, where she has been putting in long hours due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Mascitti had recently released an album when she debuted on Idol at the beginning of 2020. She narrowly missed the Top 20, placing 21st in April of 2020 before fans voted her off, but by then, the pandemic had taken hold in earnest, scuttling her plans to perform live to support her God Made a Woman album.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Slay Your New Year's Resolutions</h2><time>Mar 10, 2024</time>
