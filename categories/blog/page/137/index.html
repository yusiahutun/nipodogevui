Do you consider yourself to be country? Do you pride yourself on how many pairs of wellies you own, the fact that you've never missed an episode of The Archers and the size of your raspberries (homegrown, of course)?
You may not even live in the countryside (...yet) but you know deep down that you're an open-air, Sunday walks and open log fire kind of person. Answer the questions below and get a feel for your country-ness.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>The Artists Studio</h2><time>Feb 24, 2024</time>

Studio: Clay Space at Fish House Art Center, 4745 SE Desoto Ave., Stuart
Medium: Clay
Gail Kosowski’s personal ceramics studio and community pottery workshop is a popular place to take a spin on the potter’s wheel and purchase custom pieces of ceramic art. Named Clay Space, the waterfront studio boasts the perfect location for creativity to thrive—in both Kosowski and her students.
“I initially opened the studio in 2015 to have an outlet for my own explorations, but I’ve slowly evolved it into a shared creative space where I can ply my trade, teach and share access, and create a good experience for beginners and fellow artists,” she says.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>the fight for athina | South China Morning Post</h2><time>Feb 24, 2024</time>

Since the death of her mother, Christina Onassis, 10 years ago, Athina has been raised by Roussel, Christina's fourth husband. He says he has tried to give her a modest, down-to-earth upbringing. The family lives in a stuccoed bungalow on the outskirts of a small Swiss village. 'For Athina it is very important to have the big support of the family and parents. My children are very close, all of them, and that is the best support they can have in life,' Roussel says.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Hong Kong singer Keung To more handsome than BTS, Chris Hemsworth, Pedro Pascal?

In an unusual agreement, Novartis will pay $87.5 million for a gene therapy candidate from cash-strapped Avrobio gene therapy without agreeing to any milestone payments or royalties in exchange for the clinical-stage product. The announcement follows rumors that Novartis was preparing to acquire the biotech.

Data from a phase 1/2 experiment sponsored by the University of California, San Diego showed that after receiving the treatment, the first five patients had ceased using oral cysteamine, the medication used to treat the accumulation of cystine crystals that causes cystinosis.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Video shows North Carolina mother forcing child to smoke marijuana</h2><time>Feb 23, 2024</time>

<a href=../../../../strap-on-sex.html></a>
With more and more women talking openly about sex, there’s one phrase that continues to delight, confuse and raise a few eyebrows: strap-on sex.
Strap-on sex tends to be thought of as controversial. Sex toys themselves are still controversial, with heteronormative myths giving them something of a reputation. I’ve heard everything from dismissals like, “You’re just using them until you can get the real thing,” to insecure statements like, “Well, my penis can’t vibrate and remain erect endlessly, so cis men are going to be useless eventually.</article><nav class=main-nav><a class=prev href=../../../../categories/blog/page/136/>← Prev Page</a>
