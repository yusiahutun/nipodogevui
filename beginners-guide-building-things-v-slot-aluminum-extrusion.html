What Is Aluminum Extrusion? Aluminum extrusion is aluminum that has been extruded through a funny shaped hole called a die. Similar to how many plastics and food are manufactured, hot metal is squeezed&nbsp;through a shaped hole that produces a useful product."><meta name=author content="Martina Birk"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

Similar to how many plastics and food are manufactured, hot metal is squeezed&nbsp;through a shaped hole that produces a useful product. This is a somewhat simplified view, so if you would like to know the finer points of the manufacturing process, have a look <a href=#>here</a>.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>This may sound like a lot of effort, however it has many advantages. Extruded aluminum is actually stronger, lighter, and uses less material (meaning it's cheaper) than its solid counterparts. Extrusions come in a wide variety of shapes, so&nbsp;a variation suitable for your specific use case can often be found. Finally, aluminum is very easy to work with using only basic tools. It's often not suitable for heavy-duty applications (such as fighting&nbsp;<a href=#>battlebots</a>), however you may be surprised at what can be made with it.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><h2 id=v-slot-vs-t-slot>V-Slot vs. T-Slot</h2><p>There are many different shapes of extrusion available. The shape of the cross section is called the profile. There are two main profiles that are useful to you: T-Slot and V-Slot.</p><p>T-Slot has a <strong>T</strong>-shaped groove on each side:</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/T_Slot_Aluminium_Extrusion.jpg><p>V-Slot is similar, but it has a slight bevelled edge:</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/V-Slot-Cross-Section.jpg><p>While this may seem like only a minor difference, it has a big impact in their use. V-Slot allows bearings and wheels to sit inside the profile, meaning it can also double as linear rail, greatly reducing the cost of parts for motion control.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>The two are somewhat interchangeable, but it's usually best to stick with one type per project. Basic parts like brackets and T-Nuts work fine on either, however slightly more specialist parts -- such as bearings or unusual joints -- may only work on one or the other. Also, if you are mixing and matching parts, you may need to change or adapt your design, and have to purchase more lengths of one or the other extrusion.</p><p>V-Slot was created by Mark Carew of <a href=#>OpenBuilds</a> and is open source. While there are a few other variations available, this article will focus on V-Slot. OpenBuilds explain their system in this video:</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><h2 id=dimensions>Dimensions</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/V-Slot-20-80.jpg><p>V-Slot comes in a variety of different sizes, and the range is expanding.&nbsp;It comes in various lengths, and some distributors will even cut to length. The most popular sizes are:</p><ul><li>20mm x 20mm</li><li>20mm x 40mm</li><li>20mm x 60mm</li><li>20mm x 80mm</li></ul><p>Even the smallest diameter pieces (20mm x 20mm) are very strong, and the largest pieces are more than capable for heavy-duty purposes.</p><h2 id=cutting-and-working>Cutting and Working</h2><p>You can cut V-slot in a variety of ways. The manufacturers state that it can be cut just like timber on a chop saw, however I don't recommend this -- it's quick way to dull your blade, and unless you have a special blade for cutting metal, it may not produce a nice finish either.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>The easiest way to cut it (even the larger 20 x 80) is by using a <a href=#>hacksaw</a>&nbsp;(<a href=#>UK</a>). Use an <a href=#>Engineer's Square</a>&nbsp;(<a href=#>UK</a>) to mark an accurate line, then slowly cut it (once secured to an appropriate work bench). Don't bother with a junior hacksaw (even for small stuff) as they are often rubbish.</p><p>Any rough areas or out of square cuts can be fixed with a <a href=#>file</a>&nbsp;(<a href=#>UK</a>). Be careful not to mark the edge of the aluminum.</p><h2 id=finishing-extrusion>Finishing Extrusion</h2><p>You can purchase V-Slot in two finishes: untreated and black. Untreated is simply the aluminum as is, whereas black has been anodized -- a chemical process that reacts with the surface of the metal.</p><p>Black looks far cooler, but is much easier to mark or damage. Plain allows you to anodize in a variety of colors at a later date. Paint is not suitable, nor is powder coating, as these both involve a layer of paint outside the part, which reduces the effectiveness of the bearings.</p><h2 id=connecting-parts>Connecting Parts</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/V-Slot-T-Nuts.jpg><p>Connecting pieces together is very easy. The most common method is through <a href=#>T Nuts</a>. These slot into the grooves in the aluminum, and allow a bolt to tighten up against them, like this:</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/T-Nut-In-Groove.jpg><p>They are fairly cheap ($12.99/100), although they can sometimes be fiddly to align multiple ones correctly. Open builds sell various joining brackets for different purposes.</p><p>If you want to save a bit of money, you could 3D print your own connectors:</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Aluminium_Extrusion_3D_Brackets.jpg><p>Alternatively, metal brackets from a hardware store can often be purchased very cheaply:</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Aluminium_Extrusion_Brackets.jpg><p>As these come in a variety of sizes, you may wish to write down some measurements to purchase brackets of an acceptable size. Using these brackets is very easy, slide two (or more) T Nuts into the channel in the extrusion:</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Aluminium_Extrusion_T-Nuts_Inserted.jpg><p>Next, line up your bracket:</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Aluminium_Extrusion_Bracket_Positioned.jpg><p>Then bolt it on using the appropriate size bolts:</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Aluminium_Extrusion_Bracket_Bolted.jpg><p>Use the same method to connect a different piece of extrusion:</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Aluminium_Extrusion_Joined_Right_Angle.jpg><p>Bearings are simply bolted on (providing the spacing is correct):</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Aluminium_Extrusion_Bearings.jpg><p>Although you may want to countersink the bolts:</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Aluminium_Extrusion_Countersunk_Bolts.jpg><h2 id=where-to-buy>Where to Buy</h2><p>The easiest place to purchase from is the <a href=#>OpenBuilds store</a>. It costs $10 for 1M of 20 x 20 up to $20 for 20 x 80. Various <a href=#>connectors</a>, <a href=#>plates</a>, and <a href=#>wheels</a> can be purchased in differing sizes and specifications, as can be seen in this video:</p><p>Amazon.com sell parts, as do <a href=#>Aliexpress</a>. While parts may seem&nbsp;cheaper on Aliexpress, the postage can often negate the price, as well as any import duties.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><h2 id=what-can-you-make>What Can You Make?</h2><p>Anything! The most common uses are for 3D printers [Broken URL Removed] (<a href=#>what is 3D printing?</a>), CNC machines, and robotics. Anything that needs smooth, linear motion is an ideal project to use aluminum extrusion in.</p><p>It's entirely possible to produce something using only off the shelf parts. If you want to save a bit of money, you can easily manufacturer your own parts using timber or plastic. Make sure to brush up on your <a href=#>DIY tech skills</a> first.</p><p>I designed and 3D printed this camera slider in a weekend:</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/V-Slot-Camera-Slider.jpg><p>I designed these parts using Google Sketchup -- it's very easy to use. Make sure you <a href=#>check out the basics</a>. If you still need some inspiration, take a look at these <a href=#>computer workspace upgrades</a>, enhance these <a href=#>IKEA office hacks</a>, or maybe you could build a <a href=#>smart home</a> like in Mr. Robot.</p><p><strong>Have you built anything using aluminum extrusion?
