While novelty-hungry fashion insiders may feel that her collections have been a bit repetitive in recent seasons, her hybrid garments (Is it a peacoat or a down jacket? A pleated blouse or a jumper?) keep her loyal customers coming back for more.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/03/06/7d4d6c2f-cbbc-4379-b26b-d45803725953_12a69b9d.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Though she always sticks to her true-and-tested formula, she often plays with volumes and proportions to add an extra element of surprise to her pieces. This season, she approached clothing as armour, thinking of the “emotional protection that clothes can afford”, especially in these difficult times.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Here, in chronological order, are three highlights from the final day of Paris Fashion Week – plus a surprise show from Saint Laurent.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">Chanel</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/03/06/911d584a-9217-4e07-bf7e-d906dac58ea3_42f9bc09.jpg>Chanel may be associated with <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">its legendary address on Rue Cambon in Paris</span></a>, where Gabrielle “Coco” Chanel opened her first boutique, a hat shop, in 1910, but she actually unveiled her first fashion creations in 1912, in her second shop in the resort town of Deauville, on the coast of Normandy.<img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/03/06/d8f54346-84ae-4b64-bcfa-907bddcad391_d5301715.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">It was in Deauville where she first started offering the loose silhouettes, menswear-inflected garments, and fishermen-inspired Breton shirts that freed women from the constricting corsets of the Belle Époque.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The brand’s creative director Virginie Viard penned a “love letter to Deauville” for autumn/winter 2024.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/03/06/f327b3c7-c900-4c97-a7c0-4f11f9cd8276_3a9bc656.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">While you would think that choosing a seaside resort as inspiration for an autumn/winter collection would be strange, it actually worked. Unsurprisingly, cropped fishermen’s pants were a key element of the silhouette. One of the best looks was a white belted jumper paired with matching cropped trousers and platform boots. Among the other key pieces were knit dresses featuring seascapes and seagulls inspired by Deauville, and a series of superb sheepskin jackets, especially one that was a cool riff on the signature Chanel jacket.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/03/06/9deb14e5-4b96-4f14-a663-c11b76986ee6_af165c35.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Every look was accessorised to the hilt as only Chanel can do. Maison Michel, the milliner behind all Chanel hats, must have been very busy in the lead-up to the show as most of the outfits came with hats – from berets to newsboy caps and wide-brimmed sun hats, some of them pinned with brooches.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Topic class="css-1wyvcgo e1b1x8aa3"></span><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Title class="css-i31uou e1b1x8aa1">The most stand-out shows at Milan Fashion Week 2024, from Gucci to Fendi</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">During the show, giant screens played recreations of the seashore of Deauville, but the video that had everyone in the audience gasp with surprise was a short starring Brad Pitt and Chanel ambassador Penélope Cruz. It was a tribute to the film A Man and a Woman (1966) by French director Claude Lelouch, which was set in Deauville.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">Miu Miu</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/03/06/0db79557-f853-4c33-bc02-8bce47fed53d_724651b8.jpg>Can Miuccia Prada keep <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">the momentum going at Miu Miu</span></a>? It’s no surprise that the brand previously known as Prada’s younger sister has been on a roll over the last few years. From the mini miniskirts of 2021 to <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">the pantless rage</span></a> and the renaissance of preppy, Miu Miu is behind the most popular recent trends embraced by the TikTok generation.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Mrs Prada, however, is not one to fall prey to viral memes and cater to social media. The autumn/winter 2024 collection was a rebuttal to all that. It was Mrs Prada’s take on banal and ordinary clothes – clothes that, although unlikely to go viral, can make even more of a powerful statement.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/03/06/6a7705c0-030b-48ef-a530-f5f409d9e8a1_90634dec.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">While there were a few nods here and there to what we’ve come to expect from Miu Miu, this time around the designer had other things in mind. Most of the outfits had a utilitarian, almost butch vibe, and could easily be worn by guys or even older men. (Like last season, there were male models in the show, a sign of the success of the recently relaunched menswear line.)</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">A number of outfits looked like workwear uniforms (nurses came to mind, both male and female) while shoes ranged from mannish loafers, men’s slippers and beat-up boots.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/03/06/d589a86b-9369-4d8f-991d-96f0ec104bde_44caa641.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In the notes, Mrs Prada referred to the collection as “individual moments” and “a vocabulary of clothing, from childhood to adulthood”.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The shrunken proportions of a few outfits and the haphazard way in which some looks were put together – is that a pyjama under a pea coat? – were meant to reflect childhood, while ladylike touches such as gloves, handbags and little black dresses were symbols of adulthood.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/03/06/3b0b3f5c-bd1b-4015-a40f-2c428385b2d6_8f72dcec.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">This show felt like a rejection of the girlie tropes often associated with Miu Miu and was yet another masterstroke from the Italian designer, who always confounds expectations. Remarkable too was the diverse casting, which included a range of women of different ages and backgrounds such as actresses Kristin Scott Thomas and Angela Molina.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">Louis Vuitton</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/03/06/0318cdae-4f92-41d0-8662-a91e574adbfe_9935400f.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Louis Vuitton’s Nicolas Ghesquière has a lot to celebrate this year. The autumn/winter 2024 collection marks his 10th anniversary at the maison, a remarkable achievement in an industry where artistic director roles tend to be short lived.</p>Late last year, the LVMH-owned label announced that Ghesquière’s contract would be renewed for another five years – a vote of confidence in his always directional ready-to-wear designs and his ability to come up with the desirable accessories that drive the business of <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">the biggest luxury brand in the world.</span></a><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Topic class="css-1wyvcgo e1b1x8aa3"></span><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Title class="css-i31uou e1b1x8aa1">Making waves: surfer girl fashion is back – from Chanel to Miu Miu</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Just like with his debut 10 years ago, the autumn/winter 2024 show was held in the courtyard of the Louvre Museum, but it was a much bigger affair attended by a whopping 4,000 guests, many of them Louis Vuitton staffers invited to commemorate the milestone.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/03/06/a2cd066a-ca94-4fc7-aa13-e9fbd978e822_1126e908.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Ghesquière left a heartfelt note on each seat, thanking his team and those who have supported his journey at Louis Vuitton over the last 10 years. It was a simple gesture that showed his softer side.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The set, conceived by the artist Philippe Parreno in collaboration with film production designer James Chinlund and featuring ball-shaped lighting fixtures that looked right out of a sci-fi movie, was a reflection of Ghesquière’s affinity for science fiction – and so was the music, which is always a highlight of his shows.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The show had a gentle start, with white looks and shimmery dresses set against a soundtrack of what sounded like primordial cries, but the music quickly picked up the pace with drum-and-bass music followed by techno beats.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/03/06/5cdf2fdc-c4e1-4eff-87bf-35d3420d3651_785f7b80.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">While you could easily see this collection as Ghesquière’s greatest hits – those of us lucky enough to have been at pretty much all of his shows will recognise bits and pieces from some of his pivotal moments at Louis Vuitton and even from his days at Balenciaga – it was very of the moment.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">It also showed the staying power of Ghesquière’s creations. Sporty windbreakers, flowy dresses paired with fur mittens, broad-shouldered neoprene jackets, hooped skirts and A-line dresses with prints of trunks – a nod to Louis Vuitton’s heritage – were all reminders of the incredible creative output of the designer over the last decade.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/03/06/52882b8a-7a7e-42f1-b280-d63c1c28c0b1_1bee8c2b.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Even when looking back, however, Ghesquière does it with an eye to the future. “Every tomorrow is a new day,” the show notes said, alluding not only to all that lies ahead at Louis Vuitton – a prefall show in Shanghai in April and a cruise show in Barcelona in May, for starters – but also to his future at a house that allows him to dare and express his remarkable creative vision.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Topic class="css-1wyvcgo e1b1x8aa3"></span><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Title class="css-i31uou e1b1x8aa1">The most memorable shows at New York Fashion Week 2024, from Coach to Tory Burch</span></p></a></h3><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">Saint Laurent</strong> <strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-2 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">(again)</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/03/06/1c6ac64a-c33a-49d2-94ba-09963841ecf7_d7572383.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The most talked-about show during the women’s autumn/winter 2024 season, even before it happened, was actually a men’s show.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Early in the week, rumours started swirling around that Saint Laurent would host a “secret” show at the very end of Paris Fashion Week.</p>It was going to be a very small affair, attended by very few editors and celebrities, and held at the Bourse de Commerce – Pinault Collection, the museum founded by François Pinault. Pinault is the owner of <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Kering, Saint Laurent’s parent company.</span></a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/03/06/5956dd78-3cb8-44ad-80be-d44fc0fd4967_a7871238.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Think loose silhouettes, broad shoulders and wide lapels.
