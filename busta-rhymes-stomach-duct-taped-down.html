"When I shot that video, there's a scene of me wearing all white with a head wrap. When I initially put that all white on, it showed how badly out of shape that I was on camera so we went in the dressing room and they duct taped my stomach down."</p><p>"It was difficult," the "Dangerous" singer continued. "Probably one of the most difficult reality checks in my life. By the way, I never shared this duct taping my stomach down part with anyone on this planet."</p><p>He went on to say the weight gain had no impact on his performances, but "definitely affected" his "appeal." His children appeared to be affected as well, according to the star.</p><p>"I think the real moments that were cutting deep was when I started to hear the conversations from my kids," Busta explained to Tamron. "The younger one, before he graduated from high school, sometimes when I would come out of the bedroom in the morning and I would put my hand out to give him a dap on the way to the bathroom or something, and he would walk past me and instead of slapping me on the hand, he was slapping me on the stomach."</p><p>"He didn't mean no harm intentionally but it was becoming annoying to me," he continued. "It was like him indirectly saying to me 'you got to rid of this gut, pop.'"</p><p>Busta would go on to lose 86 pounds, but not before he had a possibly life-saving appointment at a doctor's office.</p><p>"I was growing these polyps on my vocal cords, but what was making it worse was the behavior pattern -- the drinking and the smoking and the performing combined," he confessed on the show. "I had to go to the throat doctor because I had to actually travel to Dubai to do a show that Friday. When that doctor saw what he saw, he immediately said 'Oh my god. Oh my god. I have to send you to the emergency room at UCLA Medical and I need you to get in this ambulance that I'm calling for you now.'"</p><p>"He said 'These polyps have grown so big that it's now blocking 90% of your breathing passages and if I send you home tonight and you catch a cold, the last 10% of your breathing passages can possibly be blocked by just the regular swelling of a gland or sore throat or just catching a regular cold and you could die tonight.'"</p><p>Watch the full interview on "Tamron Hall" Monday, January 11th.</p><a id=gallery-link-d4ce9400-f5aa-5313-a13b-6c9218083841 class="media-link gallery-block__link js-track-link js-click-gallery" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:gallery:d4ce9400-f5aa-5313-a13b-6c9218083841 data-context='{"name":"gallery-block","section":"permalink"}' data-container-ref=toofab:article:5b71d6ae-2027-45a0-b93d-3a95a74827e6 data-gallery-layout=carousel><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/86/4by3/2017/11/10/86131c1defd95572a524e09fad12ef11_md.png width=825 height=618 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class="media-credit gallery-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3J7j2pmaXFfl8K0wMBmqaGxnZrAbr%2FTqKSam5hisbav02armqiVmXqlu9anZg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./sierra-deaton.html><span>←</span><span>Sierra Deaton Biography</span></a>
