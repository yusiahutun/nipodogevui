More than two-thirds of people on the island now identify as Taiwanese instead of Chinese.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Only a handful of countries have formal diplomatic relations with Taiwan, but its most important unofficial partner the United States is legally bound to help it defend itself.</p><img

great job in improving cross-strait relations and had signed a number of agreements with the mainland.</p>But he complained this had not translated into strong support for Ma or the <a class="euc41pk0

the appointment of the pro-independence Lai Shin-yuan as head of the Mainland Affairs Council, which guides cross-strait policy.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Su said Lai not only failed to promote Ma’s achievements but remained “resistant to conciliation” and “diluted [cross-strait] civilian exchanges”.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Ma had neglected his KMT base and wanted to win goodwill from the DPP, even though it opposed and boycotted his policies.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Su also described Ma as a “clean freak” who was reluctant to get too close to some KMT legislators for fear he would be tainted by accusations of corruption, adding that this pushed away some people who would otherwise have wanted to work with him.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“He seemed to take note of ‘petty matters’ but not the ‘big things,’” Su said, adding Ma would “tie himself up in meticulous details that made him lose sight of the big picture, which is what a leader should do”.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=#

indifferent to signing up future talents, which had weakened the party’s influence.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Ma would easily “back off in the face of harsh criticism from the opposition camp and poor opinion ratings”, Su said, citing a U-turn on building a nuclear plant that he had previously supported.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Su said Ma would “sacrifice the knights to save the king” pointing to a number of politicians who resigned after taking the blame for government failures, including Liu Chao-shiua who stepped down as premier following a serious flood.</p><img data-qa=BaseImage-handleRenderImage-StyledImage

colleagues for their services,” but it was “unlikely president Ma would respond to any of their comments”.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“But
