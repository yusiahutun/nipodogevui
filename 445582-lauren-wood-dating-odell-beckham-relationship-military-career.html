For her schooling, Lauren attended the Lorien Wood School. She then proceeded to the Horry Georgetown Technical College. Unfortunately, she has not revealed when she graduated from <a href=#>college </a>or the course she undertook while there.</p><h2>Career</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/a67b0fe2dea34767.jpg><p class=align-left>The career of Lauren Wood can be traced back to her social media accounts. She attracted a huge following of people inspired by her lifestyle and fashion sense. This became the basis for her to launch a career as a model. She has partnered with<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"> big brands</a> like Fashion Nova, Hot Miami Styles and Pretty Little Things.</p><p class=align-left>While working for several modelling agencies, Lauren landed an acting role. Her debut on TV was in 2015 on the sixth and seventh seasons of an MTV improv comedy show titled <i>Wild N'</i> <i>Out.</i> Her performance gained a widespread appreciation that she got voted as the favourite girl by fans.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/9bc02c755369609b.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=31><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Jessica Dean biography: husband, family, salary, career, net worth</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Lauren did not abandon her social media accounts after gaining stardom but instead continued active there.

She has also been on Twitter since January 2014, and she has more than 40 thousand followers.</p><p class=align-left>One thing that attracts many fans to her social media accounts is that she is a fitness enthusiast. As a trainer, she posts videos of herself performing fitness exercises. She is obsessed with staying healthy, and her fans are eager to copy her lifestyle routine.</p><p class=align-left>One of Wood’s well-guarded secrets is that she was in the military. She revealed in an interview that she was in the military, but she preferred to keep that part of her life away from social media. That means that she is a veteran of the United States Army.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/3bff6e3e5b73f9a2.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=30><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Laurel Coppock bio: net worth, Toyota commercial, husband, family</span></p></a><h2>Husband and children</h2><p class=align-left>How did Odell meet Lolo? Lauren Wood and <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Odell Beckham </a>are said to have started seeing each other during the summer of 2019, just as the <a href=#>Covid-19</a> pandemic was in its early days. However, the two had been spotted together in September of 2018; hence it is not clear how long they have been in a relationship.</p><p class=align-left>Odell is an American <a href=#>football</a>er who plays for the Cleveland Browns in the National Football League (NFL). Beckham was born in Baton Rouge, Louisiana and went to the Louisiana State University, where he played college football. The New York Giants then drafted him during the 2014 NFL draft.</p><p class=align-left>After the dating rumours had spread, Lauren started attending Odell’s <a href=#>games</a>. She also posted a photo with Odell’s mother to confirm that she had been welcomed into the family. While the two lovebirds have been together for more than two years now, they are still boyfriend and girlfriend.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/7feaec420c51a60e.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Christie Dickinson: 7 little-known facts about James Charles' mother</span></p></a><p class=align-left>They have not exchanged vows to become husband and wife.

She is also believed to have encountered Floyd Mayweather Jr. in 2014.</p><h2>Net worth</h2><p class=align-left>Being a brand ambassador of big corporations can pay well in addition to enjoying benefits such as memberships. In addition to that, Lauren also earns from her career as a model. She is estimated to receive about $2,208 - $3,608 per Instagram post.
