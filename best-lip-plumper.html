If you're looking for a less-invasive way to plump your lips, plumping balms and glosses are a great place to start. To make achieving the perfect pout easier, we set out to find the best lip plumpers. We researched the top plumpers on the market and enlisted the help of a handful of reviewers to test out the most popular options firsthand.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">After thoroughly testing 27 lip plumping balms, glosses, and serums — taking into account comfort, plumping power, and hydration — we determined the top six lip plumpers. In the end, the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Patrick Ta Major Volume Plumping Lip Gloss</a> proved to be the key to a plump pucker and scored high in the aforementioned categories.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you're looking for the best lip plumpers to pump you up, these are the six top performers, according to InStyle testers.<br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-overall-patrick-ta-major-volume-plumping-lip-gloss></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Overall</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Patrick Ta Major Volume Lip Gloss</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Patrick Ta Major Volume Plumping Lip Gloss" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/K_7tmvqdY2E5-tnAAb-WrnnYtAA=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/patrick-ta-major-volume-plumping-lip-gloss-46e0ee384e0445bfbc2648395ac73071.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Sephora</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Feel</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Plumping Ability</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Hydration</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don't Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If Gigi Hadid, Megan Fox, and Kim Kardashian swear by Patrick Ta's eponymous line of richly pigmented lipsticks, eyeliners and blushes, the celebrity makeup artist must be onto something. Even after trying 27 different lip plumpers, testers were convinced that the brand's Major Volume Plumping Lip Gloss is the best of the best. "My lips look plumper, glossier, rounder, and poutier," one tester shares.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Not only do lips actually look different, they feel different too. "I was surprised to find that my lips actually felt nourished and hydrated while wearing the gloss," the tester says. "I didn't need to apply lip balm underneath it, which is something I usually do when I wear lip gloss." Plus, once it's on, it's on. Even after all-day wear, she didn't need to reapply it to keep her lips juicy and plump. There's variety, too. The gloss is available in five high-shine, semi-sheer shades: Clear, beige, baby pink, pink, and red.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">As a heads up, the tester noted that initially, the product felt sticky and tingly on her lips — most likely attributed to the formula's lip plumping blend of cinnamon and ginger. However, the feeling subsided after the gloss settled, leaving her lips silky smooth and tingle-free.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Ingredients: </strong>Hydrating peptides, Cinnamon, Ginger | <strong>Finish: </strong>Tinted | <strong>Shades:</strong> 5</p><ul class="loc carousel-items mntl-carousel__items"><li id=mntl-carousel__item_1-0 class="comp is-active mntl-carousel__item mntl-block" data-ordinal=0><img width=1500 height=2666 data-sizes=750px alt="Person applying Patrick TA Major Volume Plumping Lip Gloss" data-expand=300 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/W54l77f7pQu9rf7wscvfAZUcc8I=/fit-in/1500x2666/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/PATRICK-TA-Major-Volume-Plumping-Lip-Gloss-0759-Jessica-Juliao.jpg-fa4314175b25425e9925bc8e43c67158.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>InStyle / Jessica Juliao</p></span></li><li id=mntl-carousel__item_1-0-1 class="comp mntl-carousel__item mntl-block" data-ordinal=1><img width=1500 height=2667 data-sizes=750px alt="Person Closing PATRICK TA Major Volume Plumping Lip Gloss" data-expand=300 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/oAQe_ddwk_T1wLXyBreLgh-eSYw=/fit-in/1500x2667/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/PATRICK-TA-Major-Volume-Plumping-Lip-Gloss-0754-Jessica-Juliao.jpg-92b0057df46549969e45a39403c057df.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>InStyle / Jessica Juliao</p></span></li></ul><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-value-elf-cosmetics-lip-plumping-gloss></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Value</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Elf Cosmetics Lip Plumping Gloss</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="e.l.f.

This gloss wraps lips in a hydrating vitamin E and coconut oil-infused formula, resulting in a fuller-looking pout with a high-shine finish. "The formula didn't give off a very intense plumping feeling, so I was surprised when my lips looked fuller and juicier after applying," our tester shares. "The finish itself has a great amount of shine without feeling sticky or thick."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If we could change anything, it would be this formula's staying power.

But, after receiving rave reviews from our tester, we can confirm it's worth the splurge. La Mer is no stranger to luxurious products that actually work, and this plush lip plumping formula is no different. The treatment contains a cell-renewing cocktail of antioxidants and ingredients like shea butter, vitamin E, and cucumber extract to protect lips from aging while adding volume and fullness.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Our tester especially loved the application brush and how generously it swiped the creamy, hydrating formula onto her lips.

Intended to sit on your pout while you sleep, this non-tingling mask is perfect for those that bite their lips or hate constantly reapplying a gloss every few hours. "It reminds me of a comfortable, soft balm," our tester shares.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Choose between Sweet Dreams, a baby pink, and Cherry Vanilla, a sheer cherry red, and get some zzz's. Come morning, lips look fuller, smoother and, honestly, like you just got injectables thanks to its potent formula containing Maxi-Lip™ (a natural peptide that defines, smooths, and firms lips), shea butter, and hyaluronic acid. "I put the mask on before bed, and when I woke up the next morning, my lips were so hydrated," the tester admits. "The mask must have seeped into my lips right after I applied it, because it stayed on even after brushing my teeth."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">One thing we wish we could change about this mask is the packaging. The pot itself is pretty small (0.28 oz.), so if you use it every night, you'll hit the bottom sooner rather than later. Also, to apply the mask, you need to dip your finger into the pot, which isn't the most hygienic. We'd love it if it came with a mini spatula like some <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>other lip masks</a> do.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Ingredients: </strong>Maxi-Lip™, Shea butter, Hyaluronic acid | <strong>Finish: </strong>Sheer | <strong>Shades:</strong> 2</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-gloss-buxom-full-on-plumping-lip-cream-gloss></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Gloss</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Buxom Plumping Lip Gloss</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Buxom Plumping Lip Gloss" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/OoIWOCqOJwsgKq5DnUPinNkWoKQ=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Buxom-2a9b5c3f8ccd4ee7ac52a6ad9faa3c82.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Sephora</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Feel</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Plumping Ability</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Hydration</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don't Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-30 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Kiss dry, cracked lips goodbye with the help of this lip plumping, serum-gloss hybrid.

Some find that tingle to be too much, but others, like our tester, found the sensation to be an invigorating reminder that the product was hard at work. "The tingling was slightly more intense than I thought it would be, but it diminished as time went on," the tester admits. "I thought it felt good, but it could definitely be too much for some people."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-32 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">One of our favorite things about this plumper is that it's available in 10 cocktail-inspired colorways — ranging from light pinks and nudes to punchier picks like red and mauve.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-33 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Ingredients: </strong>Peptides, Hyaluronic acid, Vitamins A and B | <strong>Finish: </strong>Tinted | <strong>Shades:</strong> 10</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-serum-make-up-for-ever-ultra-hd-lip-booster></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Serum</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Make Up For Ever Ultra HD Lip Booster</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Make Up For Ever Ultra HD Lip Booster" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/bEAK9J6D24oJxzteSlXVANm_IBU=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Untitleddesign2-f3d1be6f305a48f893371d4e7d7a5adf.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Kohl's</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Feel</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Plumping Ability</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Hydration</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don't Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-37 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you're not a fan of gummy lip products, this is the pick for you. Make Up For Ever designed this multi-use serum to prep the lips for makeup. Thanks to its blend of nourishing luffa oil and hyaluronic acid, it goes on soft and the cushion-tip applicator helps to smooth out fine lines. "It never tingled, which made me question if it was working or not," our tester admits.

After honing in on online ratings, we spent 40 hours putting the 27 most popular lip plumpers to the test. We had each of our testers try the lip plumpers so that they could analyze the performance of each one and write down their insights during the process. In doing so, our testers rated each pair of lip plumpers on a scale of 1 to 5 for three key categories: feel, plumping ability, and hydration. Once the data was collected, we were able to narrow down the original pool of products to the 6 best lip plumpers.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-what-to-keep-in-mind></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What to Keep in Mind</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Ingredients</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">When shopping for a lip plumper, it's important to look at the ingredient label because the lips (and the area around them) are very delicate. "Seek out plumpers that utilize hyaluronic acid and collagen, as both ingredients help draw hydration to the top level of the skin to naturally plump and define the lips," says <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nocaes>Brian Nourian</a>, co-founder of <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nocaes>Le Jolie Medi Spa</a> in West Hollywood. He recommends avoiding harsh ingredients like peppermint oil, bee venom, and pepper extract because they boost lip shape by irritating the skin to increase blood flow to the surface. While it will give you results, it can harm your skin in the process.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Board-certified dermatologist <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nocaes>Amelia K. Hausauer</a>, M.D. agrees, stating that, "The products that cause vasodilation (the opening of blood vessels) from increased circulation can often cause irritation, redness, tingling or even an uncomfortable sensation."</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Longevity</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">How long your newly plumped lips will last depends on the product. Some products boast 24 hour longwear, while others can resemble the effects of filler when applied consistently over time. When looking at lasting power, think about the occasion or outings you'll want to wear plumper to and consider your personal preference. Usually, the longer the effect will last, the better, so you don't need to worry about reapplying. A product with color may also need to be applied more often to maintain its vibrancy.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-your-questions-answered></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Your Questions, Answered</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>What are the benefits of a lip plumper?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you're new to the world of lip plumpers and are considering giving one a try, know that there can be many benefits to applying a swipe or two everyday or every once in a while. "Lip plumpers can add an instant boost of fullness and shine, especially for special events as there is no downtime after using them and they offer instant results," Nourian says. "If you're considering getting lip fillers, lip plumpers are a nice, non-committal way to enhance your lip shape and see what your lips might look like."</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Are lip plumpers safe?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Lip plumpers rely on humectants, like hyaluronic acid, and are safe to use everyday. Dr. Hausauer notes that these products are made even better when combined with emollients, like ceramides, and occlusives, like squalane and petroleum jelly. "This trifecta is the hallmark of great lip moisturizers and are safe to use on the gentle lip skin as often as necessary," she says. She warns, though, that lip plumpers that offer a swelling effect should be used in moderation.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>How often should you apply lip plumpers?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The frequency at which you should apply lip plumpers will depend on the product and its formulation. "Products that rely on moisturizing ingredients are fine to use regularly, since they may improve the lip skin over time," Dr. Hausauer says. "Ones with harsher ingredients should be tested before wearing in order to eliminate irritation."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-what-is-instyle-picks></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What Is InStyle Picks?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Did you notice the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>InStyle Picks seal of approval</a> at the top of this story?
