The men's lifestyle and entertainment journal, formerly in print and currently online is known for its racy and inhibition-free models that have earlier graced its cover. Of them, Dolly Parton too featured in the October 1978 issue of Playboy.</p><p>However, she did not pose naked and expressed back then, “I got kind of scared when I thought they wanted me to do something … I didn’t want to be naked on the front of a magazine unless everybody would know it was a joke. I wouldn’t want to be <a href=# rel=nofollow>naked</a> even then.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/meaww.com///d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/22d14b27-90a6-4503-a006-1adcfeb7491a.1187473195><p>In the 1978 shoot, Parton was the first country star to grace the cover of the magazine. The ravishing beauty was 32 at that time and was seen donning the iconic Playboy bunny outfit and those sinister ears. For the unversed the bunny was chosen as the mascot of the magazine “because of the humorous sexual connotation,” but it was dressed in a tuxedo “to add the idea of sophistication”, Playboy’s publisher Hugh Hefner reportedly said.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/meaww.com///d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/54317462-0811-4925-9f27-0af1d774a717.490116115><p>While Parton’s little black off-shoulder dress accentuated the fun, quirky side of her on the magazine’s cover, it was not revealing in nature. “I have been asked, back in the day, but that was so totally not me. I would never do that… But that was a good article they ran in there, and it was just a fun thing to do. That was just another way I was trying to market myself, at that time, to kinda get in the mainstream…”, Parton said at the time of shoot back then.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/meaww.com///d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/4fe2c127-dccd-4f4a-92d2-464f69ce1320.1097571644><p>Later, Parton expressed her desire to not shy away from posing for Playboy magazine. However, she did not say anything if she will ever go nude. In March 2020 Dolly Parton, who celebrated her 74th birthday, made an appearance on '60 Minutes Australia' and mentioned that she wants to pose again for Playboy for her 75th birthday, our <a href=#>earlier report</a> read. “I don’t plan to retire. I just turned 74 and I plan to be on the cover of Playboy Magazine again,” she said.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/meaww.com///d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/47b6e5b9-f88b-46b0-a46d-3b938d52cc7a.jpg><p>More recently in October this year, the ‘Jolene’ star appeared on the ‘Scott Mills & Chris Stark Show’ on BBC Radio 5. There she reportedly hinted that she wants to pose for Playboy again in honor of her 75th birthday next year, The <a href=# rel=nofollow>People</a> reported. The publication says when asked to confirm or deny the rumor that she is in talks to cover the iconic men's magazine, Parton responded, "Well, there's some truth in that." "I just might do it. If I can do it in good taste and they [Playboy] want it, we'll do it along with a really good interview inside," Parton said.</p><p>We reported how Parton believed that recreating the Playboy look would be such a hoot. When asked if she would pose again for the magazine wearing the same outfit, the country music star replied, “Maybe I could probably use it,” she quipped, while adding, “B**bs are still the same.”&nbsp;If Parton ever poses for the Playboy magazine at 75, she would not be the oldest woman to pose for the explicit journal. Before her actress, Victoria Valentino had posed for the mag at 77 years old. Until now, Playboy has not given any official statement if Dolly Parton will again feature on their cover. That keeps us all guessing!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmillZbEuHrCqKRonJ%2Bhubp5z5qpraeeYsGwvMueqqxloKGuuq7OsmSsoJ%2BkwW6%2BwK6lnKCpYn56g5dmp6Kbo2K9sL%2FEnWSpnaKrxm6u1KelsmWVrb2ttcKiq2ain6q%2Fr63LZqqesKlit7C3xKw%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./why-did-entourage-get-cancelled.html><span>←</span><span>The real reason HBOs Entourage was cancelled</span></a>
