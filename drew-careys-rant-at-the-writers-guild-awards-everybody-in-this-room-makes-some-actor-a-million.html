And you deserve all the money you get.”</p><p>Drew has also been vocal on social media from the start about his appreciation of the writers during the strike.</p><p>“If you really want to thank someone for those meals,” he once tweeted back in September, “thank Bruce Helford and all the Drew Carey Show writers. They helped make me rich enough to afford it, No writers, no $. Simple as that.”</p><p>Drew’s fans have been vocal about his good nature since the WGA ceremony speech, praising him as a compassionate example to follow.</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFtZmlsX2aCcLDRnq5mm5Gnsrq%2FjKuYp6xdlsFuwMeeZLCqmamys7%2BMoKyipJRirrit0Z2qZp2mmr%2B6rs6dsGahnmLBqbXSZqmop51iuqK3xKxkrKedmnqir9OoqWaZXaK2rbjIqKVo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./agent-christianne-weiss-signs-with-33-west.html><span>←</span><span>Agent Christianne Weiss Signs With 33 &amp;amp; West</span></a>
