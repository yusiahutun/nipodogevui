On the other hand, active ingredients like niacinamide, hyaluronic acid, vitamin B3, AHA, BHA, and vitamin E are what you should look for in your face mask to get the desired results.</p><p><strong>b) Mask Type- </strong>There are different types of masks available in the market – sheet masks, gel masks, overnight masks, clay masks, etc. Pick yours considering your needs and skin condition. A sheet mask is usually used daily or on alternative days to get a healthy glow, while a gel mask is excellent for infusing hydration. On the other hand, overnight masks are mostly like moisturizers that you have to apply on your face before sleeping. However, a clay mask should be applied once or twice a week at most.</p><p><strong>c) Skin Type- </strong>Consider your skin type and concerns before purchasing a face mask. If you have oily skin, pick a detox face mask that will extract impurities from your pores. If you have dry skin, pick a hydrating mask that will infuse moisture into your skin. For irritated skin, pick a hypoallergenic or soothing mask, which will calm down the redness.</p><p>Now here's how you can incorporate the best drugstore face mask in your skincare routine—</p><p><h2 class=title>How to Effectively Use a Drugstore Face Mask?</h2></p><p>Below are the steps to follow when using a drugstore face mask—</p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>- First thing first, start by removing all your makeup and sunscreen with a cleansing wipe, balm, or micellar water.</p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>- Now, take your face wash as part of the second step of your cleansing routine, apply it generously on your face, and massage it for 60 minutes before washing it off.</p><p><strong>Step 3</strong>- Now, in this step, you can use a mild exfoliator to ensure a smooth surface.</p><p><strong>Step 4</strong>- Now, based on your preference and skin type, take your mask, and apply it over your face in a way that there is no gap!</p><p><strong>Step 5</strong>- This step is optional, you can take a toner and apply it all over your face after patting dry.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Step 6</strong>- You can also apply a couple of drops of a serum that closely addresses your skin ailments.</p><p><strong>Step 7</strong>- Now, take your moisturizer and apply it all over your face, and you are done!</p><p>Conclusion</p><p>So, that's it!
