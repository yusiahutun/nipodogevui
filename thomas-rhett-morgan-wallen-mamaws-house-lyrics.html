The two hitmakers reflect on growing up in the South with a strong grandmother to learn from. Details like the age of her car and smell of cigarette smoke indoors make us all feel young again, while the chorus sends a lesson forward to the next generation.

Each is written from personal experiences, but somehow, that translates as if it were custom to each of us. We've loved, we've longed, we've lost and we've cut loose in the country.</p>Airplay charts, sales data and streaming numbers helped make this list of country music's <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Top 40 songs of 2023</a>, but staff and Taste of Country reader opinion were most influential. Songs included on previous Top Country Songs lists were not eligible. A song may have been released in 2022, but it had to have the majority of recorded airplay or impact this year to count.<p class=photogallery-credit>Gallery Credit: Billy Dukes</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskajBprvFnKaupqSnxm%2BvzqZmraCfoq60edGhnK2sXaK8s7PAp2SwmZyhsq95zJqkmq%2BjYrWwwdKeZKWxop6wtHs%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./corona-beer-nutrition-facts.html><span>←</span><span>19 Corona Beer Nutrition Facts: Uncovering the Secrets of this Iconic Brew</span></a>
