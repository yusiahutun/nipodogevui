She remembers watching the games with her father, who was a professional swimmer, and began training when she was nine years old. But after civil war broke out when she was just 13, her life changed dramatically. “Our house was destroyed, so we had to live with my grandma, and sometimes with my aunt,” she says. “We went to school, but it was dangerous; it was the same with swimming.”</p><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/play.db7c035.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=24 width=24 alt="Play Icon" role=img title=Play style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><img alt="preview for The Swimmers | Official Trailer | Netflix" title="Video player poster image" width=2000 height=1000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/vidthumb/images/the-swimmers-1669891176.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=3 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">After four years of living in fear of shelling and sniper attacks, she and her older sister Sara made the difficult decision to flee in search of safety in Europe. “We had to risk everything for our basic human rights and start a new life. It was really hard for me, because I was abandoning everything: our belongings, my family, my friends, my home, everything.” They had heard stories about friends who had made the sea crossing and found information on smugglers and the routes they took from a Facebook group, so in August 2015, they embarked on the treacherous 25-day journey.</p><img alt="yusra mardini" title="Yusra Mardini" width=1024 height=682 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/yusra-mardini-pool-1668629013.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">BSR Agency</span></p><h6 class="css-ok56rr e94w1mj3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e94w1mj1">Related Story</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">They travelled to Turkey, where they boarded a small dinghy with 18 other people, but mid-crossing the engine on the boat faltered and it became waterlogged. Helpless and drifting, Yusra and Sara jumped into the water and swam for hours with two others, guiding the dinghy to eventually reach safe shores. “Honestly, I wasn’t thinking about anything, I was just trying to survive and to save myself and everyone on the boat,” she says. “In the moment, you’re just thinking about the simple stuff.”<br></p><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span>We had to risk everything for our basic human rights and start a new life<span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">When they arrived in Lesbos, Greece, they had been deprived of food and water for three days. A young woman helped them after a restaurant turned them away, and they then continued on to Germany, which became Yusra and Sara’s second home – although it took some time for it to feel like it. “I didn’t really accept living in Germany at first because I thought I would be there only for a while, and then we could go back home when the war ended,” says Yusra. “But that wasn’t what happened, unfortunately. The one thing that made me feel like home again was swimming.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">She began training at the Wasserfreunde Spandau club, applying her determination and resilience to the sport she loved – and the next year, she was selected to compete at the Rio Olympics as part of the first ever Refugee Olympic Team.</p><img alt="yusra mardini, a 19 year old syrian swimmer who competed at the rio 2016 olympic games as a member of refugee olympic team and unhcr goodwill ambassador, she speaks in tokyo 2020 office on august 29, 2017, where she shares her experiences at the rio 2016 games and her current activity as an athlete and unhcr goodwill ambassador with tokyo 2020 staff members photo by alessandro di ciommonurphoto via getty images" title="Yusra Mardini in Tokyo 2020 office" width=1024 height=683 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/yusra-mardini-olympics-1668629062.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">NurPhoto</span><p>Yusra at the Tokyo Olympics in 2020</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">For a long time, Yusra didn’t identify with being labelled a refugee – it came with assumptions that weren’t reflective of her experience. “You don’t choose to become a refugee, you leave your country because of war and violence,” she says. “Now, the word ‘refugee’ means so many things to me. In the beginning, I was in denial of it. But then I realised that it’s just a word, and it doesn’t matter what the word means. I am who I am.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Competing on the world stage alongside athletes from all other countries (“Michael Phelps was swimming in the same lane as me”), she realised that she was representing others like her – those who were forced to live beyond borders. “It made me proud, and it made me realise I have a voice that I can use to help people understand that refugees are normal people, who have hopes and dreams.”</p><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span>You don’t choose to become a refugee, you leave your country because of war and violence<span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">From that moment, she has worked tirelessly to share her story, and those of so many other refugees, to bring greater visibility to the dangers they have faced.

You don’t wake up every day and think about what happened in your life. But then when we saw it on the screen for two hours, it was a very emotional thing to watch,” she explains. “But this movie tells the story of millions of refugees all around the world, it’s not just my story.”</p><img alt="the swimmers manal issa as sara mardini in the swimmers cr ali gülernetflix © 2022" title="the swimmers" width=2000 height=1333 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/yusra-mardini-swimmers-unit-13080rc-1668628488.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Courtesy</span><p>A still from ’The Swimmers’</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In the next year, Yusra will launch a foundation to provide refugees around the globe with access to education and sport; she is also currently studying film and TV production in Los Angeles. “Sometimes life takes you to places that you would not imagine ever being in,” she says. “When I was young, I would have never imagined doing everything that I’m doing right now.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Swimming remains her cornerstone, the true constant in her life. “Swimming has taught me a lot: it has taught me patience; it has taught me to know when to ask for help; it saved my life,” Yusra says. “Most of all, it taught me to try again.
