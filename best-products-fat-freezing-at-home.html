In fact, it works so well, more than <a rel=noopener aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href=#>450,000 procedures</a> have been performed around the world in the decade thats followed its introduction!</p><p>As <a rel=noopener href=#>PlasticSurgery.org</a> explains, this popular non-surgical procedure works by freezing unwanted fat cells to banish them for good.</p><p>Thats because when fat cells are exposed to cold, they crystalize (or freeze), eventually dying off over time. From there, your lymphatic system can permanently eliminate them, effectively removing your unwanted fat.</p>Read More<p>The procedure doesn’t require anesthesia or any incisions, and your “skin and other structures are spared from injury” as your fat cells freeze, since they’re more susceptible to cold than other types of cells.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=can-you-try-cryolipolysis-at-home><strong>Can you try</strong> <strong>cryolipolysis at home?</strong></h2><p>The biggest drawback of cryolipolysis is, hands down, the price. According to the <a rel=noopener aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href=#>American Society of Plastic Surgeons</a>, the average cost of professional cryolipolysis in 2017 was a whopping $1,481 per session. Since the average patient will need two to three sessions per treatment area, that can quickly add up to somewhere between $2,962 to $4,443, for those of you doing the math.</p><p>Needless to say, there’s a large appeal for at-home alternatives, which have since popped up on the market. These systems also use cold temperature to banish stubborn fat, but for a fraction of the price.</p><p>While you’ll want to follow instructions carefully and be extra careful around your skin with these ice-cold products, when used properly, they can deliver impressive results. You may not see extra pounds coming off, per se, but you could see up to 25 percent less fat in your chosen treatment area according to the makers of <strong><a href=#>one such at-home brand, Isavera</a></strong>.</p><p>A word of caution: As the <a rel=noopener aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href=#>CoolSculpting Center of NYC</a> notes, ideal candidates for fat freezing will be near their goal weight with no excess loose skin but will still have enough fat (you should be able to pinch about an inch) to benefit from the procedure.</p><p>Ready to find the treatment that will work for you? <strong>Keep scrolling to shop our picks for the best products for fat freezing at home!</strong></p><p>First For Women has affiliate partnerships so we may receive compensation for some links to products and services.</p><h2 class=block-product__title><a href=# rel="noopener sponsored nofollow">NuBODY Skin Toning Device</a></h2><span class=block-product__eyebrow>Best fat freezing device for thighs</span> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/12/Untitled-design-72.jpg><p><strong><a href=# rel="noopener sponsored nofollow">Buy from Dermstore, $399</a></strong></p><h3 class=block-product-list__title>Why we like it:</h3><ul><li>Firms</li><li>Smooths skin texture</li><li>Promotes elasticity</li></ul><p>What’s great about the <strong><a href=# rel="noopener sponsored nofollow">NuBODY Skin Toning Device</a></strong> is that it’s been clinically proven to reduce the appearance of sagging.
