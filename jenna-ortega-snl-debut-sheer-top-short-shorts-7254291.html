She topped off her moody look with a coordinating black cape that was accented by a red flower for a singular pop of color, sheer black tights, and tall platform heels.&nbsp;</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Getty</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_6-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Ortega's nails were also painted black, and she pulled her raven tresses back into a relaxed updo with face-framing curtain bangs, while heavy winged eyeliner was offset by rosy cheeks and a soft pink lip.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>YouTube</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">During her monologue, Ortega poked fun at her various horror roles (Wednesday, X, Scream VI), saying, "A lot of people assume I’m dark and twisted in real life because of those roles that I play but I’m not like that at all. I think there’s just something about my face where people see it and say ‘Hey, let’s throw blood on that.'”<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">She kept the joke going, adding: "I love horror movies but honestly, I don’t get scared very easily. Part of the reason I wanted to come host SNL is that I wanted to face my biggest fear – happy, extroverted people who are always trying to perform.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57yZ6lp5ldpL%2B1scaaZKymnGKxpq7UrWSsoJWav27AzqlkrKCfp8Fuv8eoqa2rXWx%2FdoCRcmg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./famous-movie-coats.html><span>←</span><span>20 Famous Coats in Films</span></a>
