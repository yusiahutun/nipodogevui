And while not many famous duos have been able to do it, there are a few who managed to keep things so low-key that people barely knew they were ever an item.</p><p>In fact, some celebs didn't spill the details on their very private relationships until years after they split, totally shocking fans and followers. Even though these secretive relationships didn't last, it's important that they got the privacy they deserved at the time!</p><p>Read on to get the details about these unexpected couples…</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:e49eaecc-ff3c-4327-9065-e6d9c55d0531 data-container-ref=toofab:article:06cc8d0f-318e-472e-8866-f2b8eed94a29 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/58/5by4/2021/09/23/58afc38dc28b4b0f8f7eae9739708d3f_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">11 Female Stars Who Completely Shaved Their Heads</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p><strong>1. </strong><a href=#><strong>Dax Shepard</strong></a><strong> & </strong><a href=#><strong>Ashley Olsen</strong></a></p><p>Dax Shepard recently revealed that he briefly dated Ashley Olsen "15 or 16 years ago." The actor, who admits he never watched "Full House," says Ashley was busy launching her clothing line The Row at the time and he was incredibly impressed by her work ethic.</p><p>"She's just the most wonderful person. She's fantastic...I just saw her at a party and was kind of thunderstruck by her beauty," Dax said on his podcast "<a href=#>Armchair Expert</a>."</p><p><strong>2.</strong><a href=#><strong> Halsey</strong></a><strong> & Matty Healy</strong></p><p>Early in her career, Halsey was close friends with The 1975 frontman Matty Healy but many fans had no idea the pair actually dated. After the band's song "She's American" went viral on TikTok, users began discussing the fact that the song was very likely written about Halsey. While Matty has not confirmed who the song was written about, Halsey has admitted that the singer was definitely an influence on her music. In fact, fans believe the majority of her "Room 93" EP as well as her song "Colors" were written about Matty.</p><p>"We're both attracted to characters, and we saw that in each other. I spent a lot of time watching him and he spent a lot of time loving being watched," Halsey once told <a href=#>Billboard</a> about their connection.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:71d16645-7e5a-4094-a744-c7cda2a4f41f data-container-ref=toofab:article:06cc8d0f-318e-472e-8866-f2b8eed94a29 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/ed/5by4/2021/09/23/ed1995f78ae24203ba726cccb0a0087b_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Celebrities Reveal Their Weird And Wild Fan Experiences</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p><strong>3. </strong><a href=#><strong>Courteney Cox</strong></a><strong> & </strong><a href=#><strong>Adam Duritz</strong></a></p><p>Fans may know that Counting Crows frontman Adam Duritz briefly dated Jennifer Aniston, but it's less well known that he also dated her "Friends" co-star Courteney Cox. Shortly after Jennifer and Adam's split, Courteney starred in the Counting Crows' music video for "A Long December," where the duo reportedly hit it off. While Courteney and Adam haven't shared details about their time together, Adam has confirmed that he dated both Courteney and Jennifer.</p><p>"They were nice girls and I went out with them and that was that," Adam told <a href=#>Men's Health</a>.</p><p><strong>4.</strong><a href=#><strong> Amy Poehler</strong></a><strong> & </strong><a href=#><strong>John Stamos</strong></a></p><p>John Stamos admits that he once asked Amy Poehler on a date -- but she didn't know it was a date! While reflecting on their dinner together in an interview, Amy explained that at the time, she wasn't sure if John had more serious intentions. She even showed up to their outing in a Leslie Knope shirt from the set of "Parks and Recreation" because she thought it was going to be a more casual evening. Shortly after Amy's interview aired, John confirmed that he did have slightly more romantic intentions.</p><p>"We're really good friends…I guess [Amy] didn't know it was a date. I asked her out on a date. And we had a really nice time. Then I hear she thought it wasn't a date. It was a date in my eyes," John told <a href=#>Extra</a>.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:14ddc25e-3b17-46e0-b56f-2c97cd6e60f5 data-container-ref=toofab:article:06cc8d0f-318e-472e-8866-f2b8eed94a29 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/37/5by4/2021/08/11/37275df335ad40f28912eb4817ba8551_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Instagram</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">10 Celebs Who Definitely Don't Want Their Kids To Be Actors</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p><strong>5.</strong><a href=#><strong> Drew Barrymore</strong></a><strong> & </strong><a href=#><strong>Christian Bale</strong></a></p><p>When they were just teenagers, Drew Barrymore and Christian Bale briefly dated. Christain explained that the duo met up to go to the movies together but unfortunately, it didn't go further than that.</p><p>"We went to see some bloody awful horror film, and that was the end of it. She never called again," he told <a href=#>GQ Australia</a>.</p><p><strong>6. </strong><a href=#><strong>Pink</strong></a><strong> & </strong><a href=#><strong>Joey Fatone</strong></a></p><p>Back in the early 2000s, Pink and NSYNC's Joey Fatone went on several dates, although they have slightly different recollections about their relationship. While Pink once <a href=#>said</a> that Joey was "in love" with her, he says it was a little more casual than that.</p><p>"I actually asked her out a few times and we went out. We were cool as heck. But I guess I wasn't her type, so that was it. We were still friends. That was it…I'm cool with being in the friend zone with Pink. There's nothing wrong with that," Joey told <a href=#>People</a>.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:e4748790-5bff-460a-9632-09d25ac5cac9 data-container-ref=toofab:article:06cc8d0f-318e-472e-8866-f2b8eed94a29 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/7a/5by4/2021/03/08/7aed6906572248cf9e7e7716f7a31c76_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Instagram</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">9 Celebrities Who Turned Down Being On The Bachelor</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p><strong>7. </strong><a href=#><strong>Chrishell Stause</strong></a><strong> & </strong><a href=#><strong>Matthew Morrison</strong></a></p><p>Early on in her career in Hollywood, Chrishell dated Matthew Morrison. The duo met in 2006 and dated for a year before Matthew popped the question. Unfortunately, the couple never made it down the aisle as Matthew broke off the engagement. He later <a href=#>admitted</a> that he hadn't proposed for the "right reasons" and had only done it because he felt "under pressure from society."</p><p>Years after the split, Chrishell shared her thoughts about the relationship, admitting on "Selling Sunset" that if she had "ended up with the person [she] was with at 25, [she] would want to kill [herself]." She didn't stop there though and even called Matthew a "dick."</p><p><strong>8. </strong><a href=#><strong>Kim Kardashian</strong></a><strong> & </strong><a href=#><strong>Nick Lachey</strong></a></p><p>Nick Lachey wouldn't exactly call Kim Kardashian his "ex" but he does admit that the duo once went on a date together. While he had a nice time, he believes she may have had some ulterior motives as the paparazzi showed up towards the end of their date.</p><p>"We went on one date…We went and saw 'Da Vinci Code' together. She left about halfway through and went to the restroom and then shockingly there were 25 paparazzi when we left the theater. I think there were other things in play on our little rendezvous…Couldn't be a nicer girl, had a great time, but no, we don't keep in touch anymore," Nick said on "<a href=#>Watch What Happens Live</a>."</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:bfa3df45-c9ea-49fd-8a48-8ba558b9dcbd data-container-ref=toofab:article:06cc8d0f-318e-472e-8866-f2b8eed94a29 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=28><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/e0/5by4/2022/03/09/e0e0199d312c46fca0fc4892d902641e_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Kim Kardashian Talks Pete Davidson, Kanye West and Having 'Disagreements Publicly'</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p><strong>9. </strong><a href=#><strong>Emma Stone</strong></a><strong> &</strong><a href=#><strong> Kieran Culkin</strong></a></p><p>Emma Stone and Kieran Culkin dated for over a year but almost no one knew about it because they kept things so quiet. The former couple met on the set of their film "Paper Man" in 2010 and went on to date throughout 2011. While the couple never spoke out about their relationship, they were spotted together on several occasions -- although <a href=#>sources</a> say they kept things so low key "you'd never think they were a couple."</p><p><strong>10. </strong><a href=#><strong>Ben Stiller</strong></a><strong> &</strong><a href=#><strong> Brandi Glanville</strong></a></p><p>Brandi Glanville once admitted that she had dated Ben Stiller in the '90s and the actor later confirmed it was true, despite being a very short fling.</p><p>"It was short-lived and it was fun, I wouldn't characterize it as a relationship. It was a couple of dates and fun. I'm not sure my wife is even aware of that," he said on "<a href=#>Watch What Happens Live</a>."</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:b01b8485-2798-46aa-b679-78d1f1875b99 data-container-ref=toofab:article:06cc8d0f-318e-472e-8866-f2b8eed94a29 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/bc/5by4/2021/09/30/bc683b42b6c241d88cb8a6d88935c147_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">YouTube</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Top 10 Most Expensive Music Videos Ever Made</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p><strong>11.</strong><a href=#><strong> Heidi Klum</strong></a><strong> & </strong><a href=#><strong>Anthony Kiedis</strong></a></p><p>Heidi Klum clearly has a preference for musicians! Back in 2002, Heidi dated Red Hot Chili Peppers frontman Anthony Kiedis for less than a year. Looking back on the relationship, Anthony had nothing but great things to say, calling their time together "magical."</p><p>"The time with Heidi is one of the most beautiful memories in my life. The hottest woman in the world was my girlfriend, that made me really proud. I saw her and immediately fell in love with her. [It was] not very long, but very intense…She is not only beautiful, but also intelligent, a successful businesswoman, and [a] great mother. I was and I am still a big fan of her," Anthony <a href=#>said</a> in a Press Portal interview.</p><p><strong>12. </strong><a href=#><strong>Scarlett Johansson</strong></a><strong> & Jack Antonoff</strong></p><p>Scarlett Johansson and music producer Jack Antonoff, who rose to fame working with Taylor Swift and Lorde, dated as teenagers at New York's Professional Children's School. The former couple even attended prom together during their senior year. Although they dated for a period of time, things didn't seem to end well based on the song "Better Love" released by Jack's band Steel Train.</p><p><strong>13. </strong><a href=#><strong>Lamar Odom </strong></a><strong>& </strong><a href=#><strong>Taraji P. Henson</strong></a></p><p>Shortly before Lamar Odom married Khloé Kardashian, he says he briefly dated Taraji P. Henson. The former couple hit it off at an HBO party but they eventually parted ways after Lamar met Khloé. The basketball star says he wishes he had "done things different" while dating Taraji and admits he was "an immature punk" at the time.</p><p>"I learned a lot from her because that was the most significant relationship as a grown up that I had with a Black woman. I used to carry her picture on the road with me. Don't nobody know that. She gave me inspiration, you know what I'm saying? A black woman working like that, that's just as good at her craft that I'm as good at my craft," Lamar said in his 2019 TVOne documentary, "Uncensored."</p><a id=gallery-link-46c5b0f1-ee76-42db-9420-a09df6d048ec class="media-link gallery-block__link js-track-link js-click-gallery" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:gallery:46c5b0f1-ee76-42db-9420-a09df6d048ec data-context='{"name":"gallery-block","section":"permalink"}' data-container-ref=toofab:article:06cc8d0f-318e-472e-8866-f2b8eed94a29 data-gallery-layout=carousel><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/21/4by3/2022/03/14/21616943b1ea47f7a3407e0c9b8e1008_md.jpg width=825 height=618 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3N7j2xma2hfZoBussCmpq6rXZi8trzLnqpmsZ%2BqerG%2BzpuYm6SpYrWisIynpmahlJqubrDArZydZw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./drake-honestly-nevermind-instagram-profile-siphesihle-ntsungwana.html><span>←</span><span> Drake Surprised 'Honestly, Nevermind' Painter With Instagram Profile</span></a>
