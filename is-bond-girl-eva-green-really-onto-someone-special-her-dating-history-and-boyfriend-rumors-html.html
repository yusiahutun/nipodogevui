But it’s unusual to see their co- workers being trapped by that beauty. In this regard, today we are talking about a gorgeous actress whose beauty is inescapable be it for her fans or co-workers.</p><p>A French actress and model, Eva Green manages to stay in the limelight of media because of her relationship. Eva mostly hooks up with actor and director and that invites her to become the headlines of tabloids. Let’s find out her past relation and current affair in our story.</p><h2>Her Past Relationship With Marton:</h2><p>If you are a Hollywood fan you may not have missed watching movie “kingdom of heaven”, which released in 2005. &nbsp;The actors, Eva Green, and Marton Csokas, met on the set of the movie. Soon after, Eva and <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Marton started dating each other from 2005</a>. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-198 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>The couple stayed in a long distance relationship for three years after the completion of the movie. In 2008, Marton moved to London in order to stay with his darling, Eva. But sadly, the following year they broke the relation and got separated.</p><p></p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-199 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span><strong>Caption: Eva Green and ex-boyfriend Marton Csokas in London Film Festival in October 2008.</strong></p><p>Source:&nbsp;air.news.gr</p><h2>Who is she Currently Dating? Boyfriend?</h2><p>After the separation with Marton, there was a long silence in her love life. &nbsp;In 2015, she resumed romance in <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">her life dating her director for “Miss Peregrine”, Tim Burton</a>. Tim Burton was previously married to Harry Potter actor, Helena Bonham Carter but they separated in late 2014. &nbsp;Tim and his ex-wife stayed in relation for 13 and had two children.</p><p>Although Eva and Tim have an age gap of about 22 years, they are going smooth in the relation. Tim shared the impression he created about Eva after their first meeting in <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">an interview with esquire.com</a>. &nbsp;Tim believes that Eva is far beautiful inwardly than her outer beauty. He also confessed about their typical introvert nature. He said, <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-600 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>“Eva was not instantly knowable. There was something private and mysterious about her, and that’s not common in this day and age. People think she’s ‘dark,’ but she’s more interesting than that. People assume I’m dark too, but I’m really not. Is it just because I wear dark clothing? Do people want me to be in a white suit, like Mr. Roarke from Fantasy Island?! Eva faces the same dilemma. We share a complicated way of looking at things. We both have an interest in the unusual.”</p><p>Well, not only her boyfriend but Eva also doesn’t leave space to praise about Tim. Eva confessed in an interview that she has always been his big fan and dreamt of working with him. She said,</p><p>I've always been a big big fan of Tim's, so it was like a dream come true. He's a very sensitive man, very humble. And he's so creative, you get near him and it's very electric. It's contagious. It's as if he has five people in his head and it's always very active. He's great because he's so open to suggestions, like Chloe said. That is a real luxury for an actor”</p><p><strong>Caption: Eva Green talking about Tim Butron, published on May 24, 2016.</strong></p><p>The couple is sharing great intimacy and is often spotted together. They were seen laughing strolling through the street of Fitzrovia after having dinner at a Japanese restaurant in December last year. We found some of their photos in the street that night from a source.</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-601 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_8"></span><p><strong>Caption: Eva Green with her boyfriend, Tim Burton&nbsp;street of Fitzrovia (2) in December 2015.</strong></p><p>Source: dailymail.co.uk (2)</p><h2>Eva Green's Short Bio:</h2><p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-602 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span>Born on 5 July 1980, Eva Green started her career as a theater artist before entering in movies.
