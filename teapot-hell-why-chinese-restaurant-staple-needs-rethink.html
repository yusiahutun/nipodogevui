The sight of him next to the teapot brought back memories of that scalding experience and I couldn’t help but wonder – why are we still using it?</p><figure data-qa=Component-StyledFigure class="css-1eav71q e1haapfp2">This teapot ticks all the boxes but the only thing it does not do is pour a decent cup of tea</figure><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">But first, is the teapot really that bad?</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Yeah, it leaks and it’s purely just a bad spout design. The tip of the spout is too fat, and the angle is wrong,” says Kenny Son Yong-soo, a Sydney-based object designer, whose creations include a famous line of teapots.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“But it’s impossible to craft a thin spout with the cheap material they use,” Son adds.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The handle is too flat, making it almost impossible to hold, and the recessed lid keeps falling off because of how far one must tip the wide teapot to get all the tea out.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Ergonomics have not been thought out at all in making that teapot,” he concludes.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2021/12/06/98648d7e-752c-48d8-a8f0-dc51332f7279_7bb157a9.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The traditional Chinese teapot has been sold by ceramic suppliers since the 60s. “We’ve been buying the same teapots since the restaurant opened and we’ve been in business for over 60 years,” says Tam Kwok-king, general manager and director of Hong Kong’s Fung Shing Restaurant.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“The teapots have a lot of wear and tear in a busy restaurant. The spout and the lid suffer the most damage and this design lasts a bit longer than others.”</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Topic class="css-1wyvcgo e1b1x8aa3"></span><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Title class="css-i31uou e1b1x8aa1">Why are truffles so expensive, and which species is the best?</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In an attempt to reduce the damage from the ravages of daily yum cha use, Tam and other restaurateurs have attached a plastic tube to extend the teapot’s spout, which reduces the leak and protects the ceramic. They’ve also attached fishing lines to tie the lid to the handle, preventing the lid from falling off.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Back in the 80s, we bought rubber tubing at the hardware store to extend the spout. Now, there are specially made plastic extenders and they work very well,” says Tam.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2021/12/06/05598c7d-1a79-4db6-8211-c6ec5c0a2b86_87eb9b66.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Because tea drinkers have been complacent about the leaky teapot, the problem is a global one.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“We don’t pour our own tea when we go to yum cha,” says Barbara Ackerman, a New Jersey resident in the US. “Our waiter usually takes the teapot to a separate table behind us and it leaks all over the side table when he pours our tea.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Son’s suggestion that cost is involved in the decision rings true. We asked Jonathan Yee, director and general manager of Emperor Garden, one of the oldest Chinese restaurants offering yum cha in Sydney, Australia, if he had explored better teapots for the lunch crowd.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">His answer was succinct: “Nope, due to wear and tear, cost plays a big role in the choice of purchase.” He confirmed that this is the most prevalent teapot in Chinese restaurants outside Hong Kong, because it is the most budget-friendly.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Despite being ungainly to use, the cost effectiveness has caused the teapot with the leaky spout to be used worldwide.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2021/12/06/5136cd1f-9643-47c7-9db0-3bd90b82f91f_d52053d5.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“It really just evolved from dining culture,” says Kezia Chan, tea master of Michelin-starred Chinese restaurant Rùn, at The St. Regis Hong Kong. “People started to serve themselves tea at the table, so a bigger pot was needed.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">If that’s the case, then a bit of tea and dim sum culture needs to be explored.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Pre-war China was the time of the Mandarins. No matter high- or low-ranking, a Mandarin owned land and a big house that served not only as abode, but as something of a town hall, where meetings took place and big events in the village such as weddings and Lunar New Year celebrations were held. We can still see remnants of this culture in Hong Kong’s New Territories.</p><figure data-qa=Component-StyledFigure class="css-1eav71q e1haapfp2">Ergonomics have not been thought out at all in making that teapotKenny Yong-soo Son</figure><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Tea houses were a place outside the home where the rich and powerful would gather to chat or talk business. Dim sum was in its rudimentary form and the tea itself was the star of the show.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Back then, teapots were made of clay and much smaller as dedicated wait staff would walk around with a huge brass kettle full of boiling water to refill the guests’ teapots. The Chinese have a saying, “boiling water makes the best tea”. And without any technology to keep the water warm, this arrangement served the purpose to make the most enjoyable brew.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Topic class="css-1wyvcgo e1b1x8aa3"></span><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Title class="css-i31uou e1b1x8aa1">5 celebrity break-ups that shook Hong Kong</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">There is also lore connected to the clay texture of these small teapots. As unglazed clay is porous, tea enthusiasts would keep a separate pot for every different kind of leaf they drank. Eventually, when the teapot had absorbed enough of the tea aroma, pouring boiling water into the same pot should produce the fragrance of the tea it housed. This practice is observed till this very day.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I keep different coloured unglazed clay pots for different teas, as some of our regulars are very particular about their teapots too,” says Chan.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2021/12/06/385dc426-74f7-44b9-a6a2-8deb91386cb3_87eb9b66.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Pre-war Hong Kong was a port colony known for squalor and terrible living conditions. While the local population still struggled with poverty, by the post-war years of the late 50s and early 60s, Hong Kong was stable and transitioning into a manufacturing economy. Families still lived in subdivided flats, but everyone was employed and children went to school.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">What was missing from communities was a village hall or town centre in which to gather. Customers at tea houses started asking for larger tables as families, while still strapped for cash, could afford to meet over dim sum and tea at restaurants. This meant the teapots had to be big enough to fill every cup of a large table at least once, with some to spare.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Topic class="css-1wyvcgo e1b1x8aa3"></span><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Title class="css-i31uou e1b1x8aa1">What is ‘three-yellow’ chicken, and why are top chefs going crazy for it?</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“A traditional teapot for the home would have a single handle arching over the top,” says Chan. “That is optimal for serving over a table or standing up. But if you’re pouring tea for someone sitting next to you, you can only use a side handle, or you’d be dangling a pot of boiling water over your head.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">So ceramicists fashioned a large version of the only side-handled teapot they knew, the small individual clay teapots. In the 50s and 60s, dishes were still washed by hand and inevitably, a shorter spout would have reduced the damage and chipping.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Glazing the teapot served two purposes – durability and easier cleaning,” Chan adds. “Not everyone could have a teapot for different teas – the last thing you want is the pot absorbing the fragrance of all the different teas.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2021/12/06/ab731eeb-fb56-4907-b0d8-3f7eb35887ae_d52053d5.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Another practical aspect was that with a larger teapot at each table, the number of wait staff a restaurant would need on the floor was reduced. Imagine a dining room with 10 tables seating 12 people each. The more water the teapot on the table could hold, the less staff you would need to refill with boiling water.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Economical, durable and very practical for diners to serve themselves, this white ceramic teapot ticks all the boxes for restaurant owners and customers. The only thing it does not do well is pour a cup of tea properly.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In this world of disruptive innovation, this teapot is ripe for the taking. Surely there is an Elon Musk of ceramics out there who can make a teapot that does not leak, at the price of the current one, if not cheaper? Have a heart for the children and their poor, crushed and burning fingers.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kuqKzwLOgp52jZMC1xcueZqWdmajCs7GOmqmtoZOhsnB%2FkG5vbnFlZMGmrc%2Boq2aglaG5bsPHsmScoJmjsrSxjKucrKyRqr%2BiutNmqq2ZoKGybrrEnpusZaKawam1zaQ%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./24-astonishing-facts-about-ryan-toby.html><span>←</span><span>24 Astonishing Facts About Ryan Toby</span></a>
