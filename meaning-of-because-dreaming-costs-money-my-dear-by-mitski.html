<span>Aldo Pusey</span></p><h1>Meaning of Because Dreaming Costs Money, My Dear by Mitski</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>In the hauntingly beautiful song "Because Dreaming Costs Money, My Dear" by Mitski, the listener is immersed in a world where past desires still linger and dreams come at a price. The overall theme of the song revolves around the delicate balance between dreams and reality, and the persistence of hope even in the face of adversity. Each lyric adds depth to this theme, revealing unexpected and imaginative interpretations.The opening verse sets the stage for the emotional journey that unfolds throughout the song. "I can still smell the fire, though I know it's long died out," hints at the remnants of a passion that once burned bright but has since faded away. The smoke lingering in the hair and the burning eyes suggest the lasting effects of past dreams and ambitions. This lyric delves into the theme of nostalgia and how the remnants of past aspirations can still affect us in the present.The first chorus takes the listener by surprise with the line, "So darling, play your violin, I know it's what you live for." Here, the violin becomes a symbol of the protagonist's dreams and aspirations. The act of playing the violin represents a passionate pursuit and a refusal to let go of one's ambitions. The theme of perseverance shines through as the lyric acknowledges that these dreams may be difficult to achieve, but the determination to keep pursuing them remains strong.Moving to the second verse, Mitski sings, "I once lived in the sea, bring me to your ear, you can hear the tide where I used to be, though now I'm but a shell." This lyrical line takes us into the depths of longing and lost opportunities. The sea represents vast possibilities and the endless bounds of imagination. However, the mention of being a shell suggests a feeling of emptiness or a loss of self. This theme explores the concept of unfulfilled dreams and the longing to recapture the sense of wonder and purpose associated with those dreams.The pre-chorus interrupts the narrative with the simple plea, "Oh, baby, don't say 'Sorry'." This seemingly innocent line adds a layer of vulnerability to the song. It addresses the fear of disappointing others and ourselves in the pursuit of dreams. It emphasizes the importance of self-compassion and encourages us to release the burden of constantly seeking validation from others.Returning to the chorus, the lyrics, "Darling, play your violin, we will manage somehow," reiterates the belief in the power of dreams despite the challenges that arise. It showcases the resilience within the human spirit and the ability to find a way forward, even in the face of adversity. The violin continues to serve as a symbol of hope and perseverance.The bridge of the song takes an unexpected turn with the line, "Don't dare regret anything, remember what you're here for, you." This introspective lyric urges us to let go of regrets and stay focused on our purpose. It reminds us that our dreams and aspirations are what give our lives meaning and value. The theme of self-discovery emerges here, encouraging us to embrace our authentic selves and honor the dreams that drive us.Finally, in the outro, Mitski repeats the plea for the violin to be played: "Just play your violin, we will manage somehow." This final repetition serves as a reaffirmation of the hope and determination that permeate the song. It assures us that no matter what obstacles we face, there is always a way to navigate through life's challenges and keep pursuing our dreams."Because Dreaming Costs Money, My Dear" is a captivating song that delves into the complexities of dreams, nostalgia, resilience, and self-discovery. Through its evocative lyrics, it reminds us to cherish our dreams, persevere through adversity, and find solace in the music that drives our souls. It is a poignant and powerful anthem for those who refuse to give up on their aspirations, even when the world tells them it's impossible.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tLvCq5itoZNiuqbAx6ibZ5ufonyutdOsoqJnnZqur7XNoGSonl2XsqSt1KycZpyimq6utc2gZJyno6nAbrnOp5yyZZ2ueqWxwKtkm7Fdora1v8qi</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./karen-friedman-hill.html><span>←</span><span>Karen Friedman Hill Bio, Career, Net Worth, Career, Facts</span></a>
