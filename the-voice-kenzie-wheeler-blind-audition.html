The beloved talent show's Blind Auditions kicked off on Monday (March 1), welcoming returning coaches&nbsp;<a href=#>Blake Shelton</a>,&nbsp;<a href=#>Kelly Clarkson</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;John Legend...and giving a hearty "hello back" to Nick Jonas, who takes Gwen Stefani's seat after taking a season off.</p><p>Country music has always been a powerhouse on this particular reality show, and that was put front and center with the very first performer of the evening. Kenzie Wheeler, a 22-year-old Floridan with a well-executed mullet. "Yes, this is a dang mullet," Wheeler said in his intro video. "I love my mullet, I probably won't ever cut it off."</p><p>He noted that for as many people who diss his hairstyle, he has plenty of fans who want to run their fingers through it, and that he adopted the style from his dad. ("Maybe a little bit," his dad replied&nbsp;doubtfully, clarifying that he has a ponytail, not a mullet.)</p><p>That taken care of, Wheeler delivered a soulful version of <a href=#>Keith Whitley</a>'s "Don't Close Your Eyes," which had all four coaches spinning their chairs. Clarkson put a fast block on Shelton, causing him to grumble immediately after the song finished.</p><p><span id=yiv7656082353gmail-transcript1614647245909 class=yiv7656082353gmail-transcriptBlock>Calling himself the "mullet connoisseur," Shelton noted, "</span><span id=yiv7656082353gmail-transcript1614647249713 class=yiv7656082353gmail-transcriptBlock>Kelly lost her block,&nbsp;</span><span id=yiv7656082353gmail-transcript1614647250947 class=yiv7656082353gmail-transcriptBlock>so that makes me happy," and instructed the others to fight it out.&nbsp;</span></p><p>Jonas jumped in by saying that he himself wanted to block Shelton, and that he also knew a thing or two about mullets. "I'm gonna find some good photos to print out," he asserted, but added, "As a young man myself, younger than the rest of the coaches here, I think we could be a good team."</p><p>Legend took a cool approach and merely noted, "<span id=yiv7656082353gmail-transcript1614647321985 class=yiv7656082353gmail-transcriptBlock>Last season, I was able to secure&nbsp;</span><span id=yiv7656082353gmail-transcript1614647323286 class=yiv7656082353gmail-transcriptBlock>a country artist on my team, and she made it to the Lives&nbsp;</span><span id=yiv7656082353gmail-transcript1614647325889 class=yiv7656082353gmail-transcriptBlock>with great coaching from me, Kenzie.&nbsp;</span><span id=yiv7656082353gmail-transcript1614647328792 class=yiv7656082353gmail-transcriptBlock>Please give me a shot."</span></p><p>Clarkson, always the hothead (and the one who'd blocked main competition Shelton in the first place), was predictably effusive, telling Wheeler, "<span id=yiv7656082353gmail-transcript1614647334798 class=yiv7656082353gmail-transcriptBlock>I have won The Voice with two country singers.&nbsp;</span><span id=yiv7656082353gmail-transcript1614647337934 class=yiv7656082353gmail-transcriptBlock>I'm just saying.&nbsp;</span><span id=yiv7656082353gmail-transcript1614647341404 class=yiv7656082353gmail-transcriptBlock>I used my only block on [Shelton],&nbsp;</span><span id=yiv7656082353gmail-transcript1614647342806 class=yiv7656082353gmail-transcriptBlock>and since he's not an option, Kenzie,&nbsp;</span><span id=yiv7656082353gmail-transcript1614647346176 class=yiv7656082353gmail-transcriptBlock>I'm just saying."&nbsp;</span></p><p>Clarkson also rambled on about Wheeler's self-professed interest in baseball (saying she isn't particularly good at sports but she is "really good at winning singing competitions") and her love of singing in the car (another interest Wheeler discussed) with her kids.</p><p>Despite the hot fight over him, Wheeler didn't take long to decide on the obvious choice: Team Kelly. Clarkson squealed as loud as one might expect, but then related on a calmer note, "<span id=yiv8933566517gmail-transcript1614647469933 class=yiv8933566517gmail-transcriptBlock>Kenzie came out with that deep '80s, '90s country voice&nbsp;</span><span id=yiv8933566517gmail-transcript1614647472402 class=yiv8933566517gmail-transcriptBlock>that's right up my alley, and then I turn around,&nbsp;</span><span id=yiv8933566517gmail-transcript1614647476406 class=yiv8933566517gmail-transcriptBlock>and he has this awesome mullet going on.&nbsp;</span><span id=yiv8933566517gmail-transcript1614647478508 class=yiv8933566517gmail-transcriptBlock>It's kind of punk-rock cowboy. I really dig him."</span></p><p>The Voice airs Mondays and Tuesdays on NBC.
