<span>Jenniffer Sheldon</span></p><h1>Super Bowl: Coach Andy Reid downplays Travis Kelce drama and that 'push' in postgame interview</h1></header><section class=post-content><p><strong>Travis Kelce and his coach Andy Reid had a drama-filled disagreement during the Super Bowl, and while fans thought they saw the tight end ‘push’ his boss, the star talks about barging into Reid during the tense moment.</strong></p><p><a href=#>Travis Kelce </a>was seen yelling at coach Andy Reid after being upset he was taken off the field in the first quarter of the <a href=#>Super Bowl</a>. Coach Reid was knocked off balance but didn’t make a fuss over the incident. But in Travis Kelce’s postgame interview, when he was asked what he said to Coach Reid, he was shocked it was caught on camera and said he told Andy “how much I love him”.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-why-did-travis-kelce-yell-at-andy-reid-was-it-a-push>Why did Travis Kelce yell at Andy Reid – was it a ‘push’?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2024/02/GettyImages-2003881982-1024x683.jpg><p>The 34-year-old was unhappy about not being on the field when Isiah Pacheco fumbled the ball with the Chiefs eight years out, and he was seen shouting in Reid’s face. But the 65-year-old made little of the incident, and when Patrick Mahomes threw the match-winning touchdown pass to Mecole Hardman Jr, it seems he let go. Clips don’t really show a ‘push’ but more he walked into his coach.</p><p>When asked by CBS why he yelled Andy Reid, Travis Kelce replied: “Oh, you guys saw that?</p><p>“I’m going to keep that between us unless my mic’d up tells the world, but I was just telling him how much I love him.”</p><p>But the <a href=#>celebrity</a> wasn’t mic’d up, so I guess we’ll never know what he said during that moment.</p><p>Later, speaking to ESPN SportsCenter, added: “Man, I was fired up — I was fired up that we weren’t hitting on all cylinders.</p><p>“I had to give ‘Big Red’ a love tap and let him know that we were all here fighting for him no matter what. I just had to tell him I loved him real quick.”</p><p>He then gushed over Reid: “I put so much trust in him and how he goes about being a head coach, as a leader — he’s one of the best leaders in the game.”</p><p>“I can’t thank him enough for giving me opportunities year in, year out. This third one, this second one back-to-back, this one’s for him, no doubt.”</p><p>Despite the Travis Kelce and Andy Reid drama, he still has a lot of love for the <a href=#>Kansas City Chiefs coach</a>.</p><p>Trav, who <a href=#>rushed to kiss and embrace</a> girlfriend <a href=#>Taylor Swift</a> after, told reporters: “I’ve got the greatest coach this game has ever seen.</p><p>“He’s helped me a lot with channelling that emotion, channelling that passion, and I owe my entire career to that guy and being able to control how emotional I get. I just love him.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-did-travis-kelce-give-andy-reid-an-apology>Did Travis Kelce give Andy Reid an apology?</h2><p>Reid, who joked he has known Taylor before Trav even put her on blast on his podcast with brother <a href=#>Jason Kelce</a>, said Trav did come over to make amends.</p><p>He told ESPN Travis Kelce’s apology included an embrace: “He came over and gave me a hug, said ‘Sorry about that”.</p><p>“He just wants to be on the field and he wants to play. There’s nobody I get better than I get him. He’s a competitive kid, and he loves to play. He makes me feel young.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-coach-talks-about-that-push-in-his-postgame-interview>Coach talks about that ‘push’ in his postgame interview</h2><p>Andy Reid then cleared up the ‘push’ from Travis Kelce, downplaying it.</p><p>He said: “He caught me off-balance – he tested that hip out. Normally I get him a little bit but I didn’t have any feet under me.</p><p>“As much as he bumps into me, I get after him. We understand that. He just caught me off balance.”</p><p>But fans weren’t happy with what they saw between the two men on the field.</p><p>One person wrote: “Travis Kelce should be ASHAMED of himself.”</p><p>They added: “He is a grown man. SHOW SOME RESPECT…”</p><p>Another said: “Andy Reid should have sent him to the locker room and benched him for the rest of the game.”</p><p>But one <a href=#>Twitter</a> user had another outlook: “Oh, I’m gonna get heat for this one.</p><p>“But what Travis Kelce did, I did not have a problem with… Competing at the highest level is not easy, especially with all of the media/haters. I did not have a problem with it, and neither did Andy Reid… He knew he made a mistake not putting him in there that resulted in a fumble for KC. People so soft these days… y’all acting like he punched him.</p><p>“At the end of the day, they all have each-others backs and all have one goal… Winning the Super Bowl… The Chiefs and Travis Kelce wanted it more than the 49ers! That’s why they have been to the Super Bowl four times in five years</p><p>“Haters hate and sit back and watch until they have nothing else to say.”</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFtZmlqX2Z%2FcL%2FUqZyrZZKkxK15wqiYnKBdlrulxYyrnKKcXZm8uLrPpZiyq12pv6LCyKxkpJ2cmLJusNGapJplkaOxbsDHmqtmqKWotW61zWanqKuknK6usYyipa2doqu2psOO</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./how-to-play-couch-co-op-in-animal-crossing-new-horizons-with-one-switch-console.html><span>←</span><span>How to Play Couch Co-Op in &amp;quot;Animal Crossing: New Horizons&amp;quot; (with One Switch Console)</span></a>
