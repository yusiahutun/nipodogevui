And like any supportive girlfriend (and&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>maybe fiancée</a>), she's spending that time with Chris Martin as his band Coldplay tours. In a video obtained by the&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3>Daily Mail</a>&nbsp;(you can go to the paper's website to see for yourself), Martin takes a little time during the band's Naples set to stop near the front of the sound deck where Dakota can be seen taking in all the sights and sounds of the show —&nbsp;and naturally, fans of love and Coldplay alike are loving every second of it.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner readability=27><p>Corbis/Corbis via Getty Images for ABA</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_6-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">While the video doesn't reveal which song he was singing, fans got to see Dakota blowing a kiss at her beau and smiling from ear to ear. Martin returned the smile before heading back to the stage, and the clip also shows several fans around the duo soaking it all in, too.<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">During a 2021 show in&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>London</a>, Martin pointed to Dakota in the crowd and said, "This is about my universe, and she's here," before the band performed "My Universe."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The duo started dating in 2017, but didn't confirm their relationship until the next year. E! notes that in addition to making it to multiple Coldplay shows, Johnson also helped the band become more friendly to&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>fans with hearing issues</a>.&nbsp;<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"They are called SubPacs," Martin said of the technology during an appearance on the&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Conan O'Brien Needs A Friend&nbsp;podcast</a>. "Dakota, my partner, gave me one as a gift because she saw someone online experiencing whatever they are experiencing with this — it's kind of like body armor — you put it on and plug it in and it connects to the base."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Now, he explains, they have 10-20 SubPacs per show. According to the brand's <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>website</a>, the devices are part of a "patented tactile audio system that provides a new high-resolution immersive experience to all media."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"So, we started using it and it's been so amazing and it should get better and better," he noted.<br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57wqGpoqtdoq6zwMinZJ2Zm6TBonnJqJ%2Bnq5%2BjeqS7y52npZmpYrCwusKeqa1lnpa9rbHSZpmlp6diuKq%2F0mZubm1ia4V4</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./todd-russaw.html><span>←</span><span>Faith Evans Ex-Husband Todd Russaw Bio, Relationship,Career and Net worth</span></a>
