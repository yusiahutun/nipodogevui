However, it is worth first summarizing the video-game grading process for those who are new to the concept.</p><h2 id=what-is-video-game-grading>What Is Video-Game Grading?</h2><p>Essentially, you send your game to a company that specializes in this area, their experts examine it and assign a grade, then they return it to you in a tamper-proof case displaying the grade and any other relevant info.</p><p>The complicated part is the many possible defects with the plastic seal and box which the experts will check for, all of which can lower the grade awarded. If the company has agreed to grade an unsealed product (not always an option), the same level of scrutiny will be applied to the contents of the box.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>How Are Video Games Graded?</a></span></p><h2 id=upsides-of-grading>Upsides of Grading</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/cased-games-on-wata-website.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Having a professionally graded game from a firm such as <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Wata Games</a> or the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Video Game Authority</a> can be a stamp of approval. It verifies the item is not a fake and nobody has tampered with it, while the expert grade effectively ranks its level of straight-off-the-production-line perfection compared to all of the other copies in existence.</p><p>The clear plastic cases in which grading companies return video games to their customers look good on display, as well as offering a high degree of protection. For some, this is reason enough to have favorite titles graded.</p><p>A third upside of graded games is that they are arguably more saleable. Rather than try to evaluate a game themselves, a buyer might prefer to stick to graded items, where this analysis has already taken place. All they then need to do is compare grades and prices.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=downsides-of-grading>Downsides of Grading</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/retro-game-controllers.jpg><p>Depending how many games you submit for grading and how quickly you want them returned, the service can get expensive. So, if you’re only getting your items graded for personal satisfaction rather than to sell in the future, you’ll need to ask yourself if it’s really worth the money.</p><p>There is also the risk that your game could take some damage during transportation or at the grading company. The chances of this are low, though, and reputable firms will include insurance in the grading fees they charge.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>A third downside of graded games is pretty obvious; while they’re in the tamper-proof case, you can’t access them. If the box is still fully sealed in plastic, this likely won’t be a concern. But if it’s open, you’ll no longer be able to play the game or–in certain special cases–remove a battery to stop it leaking. That said, there are plenty of <a href=#>retro emulators for Android devices</a> and others.</p><h2 id=to-grade-or-not-to-grade>To Grade or Not to Grade</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/calculator-pad-pen-and-money.jpg><p>Ultimately, collectors will need to weigh up the pros and cons above before deciding whether it is worth getting any of their video games graded. It also helps to read and watch the accounts of others who’ve tried grading.</p><p>If you’re interested in having items graded but not in a hurry, we recommend starting with a single game. This will familiarize you with the process, then you can decide if you want to send off additional titles.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Your friendly local retro game store may be able to offer advice on which games from your collection most deserve grading. They might even recommend the best grading company for the job.</p><p>Finally, ask yourself whether you’re investing too much into games of one variety when there may be other all-time classic consoles you don’t yet own.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rq3KnqysnZ%2Bbe6S7zGiqoaelobFuxc6uZKCqkZmybsLInZyoZZeWuqa%2FjJympaSVmMGqu81o</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./gen-z-are-done-ikea-kooky-pottery-and-risque-ceramics-loewe-bottega-veneta-and-henry-holland-lean.html><span>←</span><span>Gen Z are done with Ikea: kooky pottery and risqu ceramics from Loewe, Bottega Veneta and Henry Ho</span></a>
