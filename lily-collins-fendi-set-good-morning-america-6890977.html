While the short frock, which she layered over a black mock-neck top, was partially concealed by her jacket, it featured shoulder cutouts and a waist-cinching gold belt. Towering 6-inch platform heels lent the actress some extra height, and she accessorized with a tiny black handbag, sheer black tights, and oversized gold hoop earrings.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Lily wore her hair in a simple messy updo, save for her <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>now-signature forehead fringe</a>, and finished the look with a bronzy-orange eyeshadow and a pink lip.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">While Collins may have opted for a sleeker look during the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>GMA appearance</a>, she opened up to the show’s hosts about how Emily’s bold fashion sense has made her “a lot more courageous” when it comes to clothing.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“In the overall look of the show, you need to have looks stand out,” she shared. “And because the production design is so wonderful as well, and Paris, alone, is a character that just, like, screams, you need to have those fashion moments. There are these incredible shapes and whimsical colors this season that we get to amp up.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57y6KjsmWTpLmttc2sZJ%2Bdnpm2br%2FErWSgp5%2BZeq670aegp59dlrqmvsicmGZuaG59eoOW</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jamie-morant-bio-age-net-worth-relationship-career.html><span>←</span><span>Jamie Morant | Bio, Age, Net Worth, Relationship, Career</span></a>
