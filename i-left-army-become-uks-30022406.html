I am not labelling every man in the industry because you get a lot of lovely people.</p><p>“But I have had men following me with their phones taking videos and pictures without asking. I have also had comments saying ‘what are you doing this is a man’s job’ and ‘you shouldn’t be driving a truck’.</p><p>“It is simple things like because I have always used a curtainsider, I have had men approach me saying ‘you will need a hand with those curtains’ and they just try and interfere with my job. It is just little things like that but I have had a lot worse.</p><p>“I’ve always had quite thick skin and nothing really bothers me.
