"I continue to stay to be shocked that he is the forgotten killer. The one who was quietly tucked away, convicted of a lesser crime and does not have to live with the burden of being forever associated with Meredith's death."</p><p>"I am the one who has been condemned to live with his infamy," she continued. "And while I can't say that I wish him suffering or imprisonment, I do wish that he had been fully held accountable for what he did and that he acknowledged what he did, and I don't know if that will ever happen."</p><p>"The only reason you know I exist is because [of] what he did, and that is a grave injustice."</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>WATCH: ABC News Exclusive: Amanda Knox speaks out.</p><p>The man convicted in the assault and rape of British exchange student Meredith Kercher is free.<a href=#>@JamesAALongman</a> reports. <a href=#>https://t.co/nPpCL4YNga</a></p>— Good Morning America (@GMA) <a href=#>December 7, 2020</a> <a href=# rel=noopener>@GMA</a><p>While Knox was studying abroad in Perugia, Italy in November 2007, Kercher, a 21-year-old British exchange student and Knox's roommate at the time, was found stabbed and sexually assaulted in her bedroom.</p><p>Knox, and her Italian former boyfriend, Raffaele Sollecito, were both arrested, with Guede being arrested shortly thereafter.</p><p>Guede's bloodstained fingerprints, the only found DNA, were discovered at the crime scene.
