Crab-stuffed shrimp is a delicious example as each piece gets filled with a flavorful crab meat mixture before it’s baked. Preparing stuffed shrimp&nbsp;might sound tedious for a pound or two of seafood, but we’ve tapped a chef for tips that make the process hassle-free. Even better, assembling the shrimp ahead of time allows you to bake them when you’re ready. Here’s how to make tasty and tender crab-stuffed shrimp for your next gathering or weeknight meal!</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>How are stuffed shrimp made?</h2><p>This dish involves filling the shrimp with a mixture of crab meat, breadcrumbs, seasonings (including Old Bay) and eggs. The shrimp are baked until they’re pink and the filling is golden brown. What you end up with are tender shrimp that are sweet and salty with hints of spice. Stuffed shrimp are best served with lemon wedges and clarified butter (a type of melted butter that has the milk solids removed) for extra richness and zing.</p><p><strong>Related: </strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">What Is Clarified Butter Used For? It’s Better Than Oil For Roasting or Searing</a></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>3 tips for making yummy stuffed shrimp</h2><p>Although crab-stuffed shrimp require some prep, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Edio Barrera</a>, executive chef and co-owner of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Marblehead Chowder House</a>, shares easy tips for perfectly cooked seafood.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>1. Butterfly the shrimp.</h3><p>In order to stuff the shrimp, you need to flatten (or “butterfly”) them. This spreads out the surface so you can flip them over and fill the opposite side. The goal is to create stuffed shrimp with a curled shape, which allows the stuffing to stay in place. It’s best to use large-sized shrimp for this as they can hold a nice amount of filling compared to smaller varieties. To see how to buttery and stuff shrimp, watch this video from <a href=#>The Anthony Kitchen YouTube channel</a>.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"></figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading>2. Opt for plain breadcrumbs.</h3><p>Breadcrumbs blend the ingredients together to create a solid filling mixture. Plain varieties like panko breadcrumbs or crushed ritz crackers work best at melding the ingredients while absorbing their flavors.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>3. Keep an eye on the shrimp as they’re cooking.</h3><p>After assembling the stuffed shrimp and placing them in the oven, you don’t want to lose track of time. Stuffed shrimp take around 15 minutes to bake at 350°F, with the flesh being opaque as a sign that they’re done. Cooking them for too long makes the shrimp tough and rubbery instead of soft and tender.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>How to make crab-stuffed shrimp</h2><p>Below, Chef Barrera shares his favorite Crab-Stuffed Shrimp recipe. While jumbo lump crab meat is best for creating a nice chunky filling, he notes that you can use less expensive options such as lump or claw meat. This dish earns rave reviews in his restaurant, so your dinner crowd is sure to love it too!</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Crab-Stuffed Shrimp</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/01/Crab-Stuffed-Shrimp_2.jpg><p><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p><ul><li>1 lb. large shrimp, peeled, deveined and butterflied with tails on</li><li>1 lb. crab meat (jumbo lump, lump or claw meat)</li><li>2 cups plain panko breadcrumbs or crushed ritz crackers</li><li>1 cup mayonnaise</li><li>4 eggs, beaten</li><li>¼ cup minced scallions</li><li>2 Tbs. chopped parsley</li><li>Pinch of dry mustard powder</li><li>Generous pinch of salt and pepper</li><li>Clarified butter (for brushing and dipping)</li><li>Lemon wedges (for serving)</li></ul><p><strong>Directions:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Yield: </strong>approximately 4 servings</li></ul><li>Preheat oven to 350°F.</li><li>In bowl, whisk together eggs, chopped parsley, dry mustard, scallions, breadcrumbs, salt and pepper.
