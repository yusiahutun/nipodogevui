She is the daughter of<strong> Jack Lipinski</strong> and <strong>"Pat" Lipinski.</strong> She was born and raised in the town of Sewell in New Jersey. While Lipinski was only two years old when the 1984 Summer Olympics were taking place, she pretended to be a champion by standing on top of a Tupperware bowl.</p><img id=postimg src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/img.marriedwiki.com/uploads/2022/12/04/on-june-10-1982-tara-lipinski-was-born-in-philadelphia-pennsylvania--1670147174.png width=450 height=450 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><strong><span class=imageCaption>On June 10, 1982, Tara Lipinski was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. </span><span class=imageSource>SOURCE: Instagram</span></strong><p>Lipinski started roller skating when she was three years old and won a national championship in her age group when she was nine. She started ice skating that same year, integrating her talents from figure skating into ice skating. In later years, Tara focused only on figure skating and attended classes at the University of Delaware in Newark, Delaware.</p><p>Since Tara's father had been promoted at work in 1991, the family decided to relocate to Sugar Land, Texas, located near Houston. She did her workouts at a public rink located in the Houston Galleria. Two years later, Tara and her mother moved back to Delaware so that she could continue her training with coach Jeff DiGregorio.</p><p>DiGregorio had been Lipinski's coach intermittently for the three years before the family's relocation to Texas. However, Lipinski's father remained in Texas to continue providing for the family.</p><p>At the 1994 U.S. Figure Skating Championships, Lipinski competed in the novice women's category and finished in second place, earning her a silver medal. At 12, she broke the record for being the youngest athlete to win a gold medal at the United States Olympic Festival in 1994.</p><p>Lipinski subsequently won first place in the Blue Swords in Chemnitz, Germany, in November, which was her first international competition. After that, the media started paying attention to her. She skated her way to a fourth-place finish at the World Junior Championships in 1995 and a second-place finish at the U.S. Championships in the same year.</p><p>Tara and her mother interviewed prospective figure skating teachers from all over the country. She took a few trial lessons from each before deciding to hire Richard Callaghan. At the 1996 U.S. Championships, which took place in January of that year, Lipinski earned the bronze medal as a senior-level skater. She finished the 1995-1996 season by qualifying for the 1996 World Championships and gained attention worldwide.</p><p><strong>Stay updated in <a href=# rel=noopener>Married Wiki</a> for more celebrity news and articles.&nbsp;</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmilkae%2FqrHDsKCkoV6YvK57wKuropucmny1rdGaZKWhoJ67tLfIZpinnF2pvKWwjKSYqaejqa60xYyiqmakmau2r7OMoZipqJmhxm6t0mafrquSlrulecCnm2avmZuybq3NnWSsnaaav6K4jLKcmqqjYrynedGeo5qsmaS7tLTIqQ%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./reba-cast-then-now-115484.html><span>←</span><span>See The Cast of 'Reba' Then and Now! - Closer Weekly</span></a>
