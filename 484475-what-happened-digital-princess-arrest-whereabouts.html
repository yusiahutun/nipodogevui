The post went viral, making Marissa follow up with a TikTok post admitting that she was indeed arrested. However, she insisted that only some things on the internet were true.</p><p class=align-left>Fans thronged social media, expressing disappointment and disgust. The pressure was too much for the social media star, and within 24 hours of posting her TikTok response, she locked all her social media accounts to the public.</p><p class=align-left>According to the police report and proceeds of the court case, the social media star told the police that she had only left her home for a short time to run to a nearby 7-Eleven and buy laundry detergent.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/275022bcce38c30b.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=30><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Cecily Strong: Net worth, boyfriend, height, movies and TV shows</span></p></a><p class=align-left>However, police found the statement fishy considering the laundry detergent bottle was half empty.
