Determined, he resorts to force, commanding his agents to abandon their ship. Utilizing S-Bear's ability, they are transported directly into Fabiriophase, leaving their ship to be destroyed by the Sea Beast Weapons. This bold move catches the attention of the locals, prompting Shaka to order an evacuation and deploy three Seraphims: S-Hawk, S-Snake, and S-Shark, all under Sentomaru's command.</p><p>As chaos ensues, Kaku attempts to ascend to the Labophase using Geppo, only to be met with a barrage of automated lasers that thwart his progress. Shaka, recognizing the imminent danger, orders Atlas to retreat to headquarters, doubting her ability to defeat the intruders. However, Atlas disobeys his command and launches an attack on Lucci. Despite her efforts, Lucci effortlessly dodges her punch and retaliates with Rokuogan, delivering a devastating blow that renders Atlas unconscious.</p><p>Meanwhile, Luffy's group engages in a conversation with Vegapunk, who requests Luffy's assistance in locating the vacuum rocket to transport the still-unconscious Bonney to the Labophase. Amidst their hurried journey, they unexpectedly encounter Lucci and the CP0 agents, and find Atlas in her unconscious state.</p><span class=f14>Advertisement</span><p>Stussy, recognizing the volatile situation, advises Lucci against engaging Luffy without explicit orders. Luffy, fueled by the rage of witnessing Atlas's critical condition, boldly declares battle against Lucci and his cohorts, setting the stage for an intense confrontation.</p><p>Chaos has arrived on the peaceful Egghead, with Lucci's brazen intrusion sparking a clash between the Straw Hat Pirates and CP0.</p><p>Stay tuned to Pinkvilla for more updates on the latest developments on Egghead Island in One Piece.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7sbXNpK2ipJyWe6S7zGicp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX5a7qrnEaKannV2ltqavxGacqaGjpLGmeZBqZ2lloqSvbrjUnJqiZaaoeq3BxZ%2BwZqqVobKiv8Rmm5qslWLAtb7EmqSippdisabAwKKjrGWVrb2mr9Oem2aonKTBbq3NnWSmp6KaenJ%2BmGttcGs%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./400766-kimberly-sustad-bio-nationality-husband-religion-movies-net-worth-html.html><span>←</span><span>Kimberly Sustad bio: nationality, husband, religion, movies, net worth</span></a>
