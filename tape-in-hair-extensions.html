Plus, the effect can be undetectable – ideal if you're after a super natural finish. In comparison to the single bonded method, the ends should stay fluffier and fuller.&nbsp;</p><p id=eN5COCagH9Hj data-wc=28>Tempted?<a class=hm-link href=#>&nbsp;Hello! Fashion</a><strong>&nbsp;</strong>caught up with hair extension artist and founder of<a class=hm-link href=# rel="noopenernofollow nofollow">&nbsp;Beauty Club London</a><strong>&nbsp;</strong>Louise Bailey to find out more about the installation process, maintenance and benefits.</p><p id=edaxb_7XoeAU data-wc=61>There are two main types of tape-ins available in the UK: invisible and regular. Invisible tape-ins have hair injected into the tape area to resemble of the appearance of a root and are best used around the top section as they tend to be bulkier. Regular tape-ins are Louise's preference because they can blend seamlessly with the rest of your hair.</p><p id=eHzG0-Wqm4va data-wc=10><strong>MORE:</strong><a class=hm-link href=#>&nbsp;The 9 best hairdressers in London, tried and tested</a></p><p id=eOJMbe83H7sl data-wc=10><strong>READ:</strong><a class=hm-link href=#>&nbsp;Summer hairstyles: 10 need-to-know looks to try in 2023</a></p><h2><strong>What does the process consist of?</strong></h2><p id=eB92sPl_ork9 data-wc=37>Tucked away behind Oxford Circus, Beauty Club London is one of <a class=hm-link href=# rel="noopenernofollow nofollow">Hair Club Extensions</a>' exclusive stockists, alongside the likes of Harrods and Hershesons. It is recommended that you book a consultation first, to discuss your desired look.</p><p id=eOZ9iFm7Nolq data-wc=51>"Tape-in hair extensions are applied in pairs. There are two parts to the product, a top part and a bottom," Louise explains. "The natural hair is cleanly sectioned, and the bottom piece of the tape is fixed to the hair sitting flush to the scalp, underneath the section of natural hair.&nbsp;</p><p id=er01l9K-FOcL data-wc=50>"Then the top part of the extension is placed and aligned with the bottom part, “sandwiching” the natural hair between the two taped sections. The tapes adhere to your natural hair using a waterproof medical-grade adhesive that stays in place until you come to the salon for maintenance or removal."</p><p id=e5AMiJM3ZxrW data-wc=21>Louise and her team employ a unique placement method to allow a seamless blend between your natural hair and the extensions.</p><p id=eUtNMok7Ho8B data-wc=53>"This process must be carried out without overloading the head with the product and positioned so the wearer can still wear their hair up and in various styles, such as low and high ponytails, without the tapes being visible. The extensions, once applied, will be pain-free, comfortable and look like your natural hair."<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><h2><strong>What are the benefits?</strong>&nbsp;</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/portrait/79e32585805d-model-with-brown-glossy-hair.jpg><p id=eWmJ1v064p8B data-wc=38>Tape-ins are a great choice if you want a method that lasts and is reusable. The method can be used for length, volume or both, and according to Louise, application is faster than any other semi-permanent extension technique.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p id=ez3ZrRlmJgvB data-wc=48>"They create a seamless, structured, groomed finish - with no stringy appearance, which is common with single bond attachment methods, such as micro rings," she says. "Your hair can be worn up in different styles with zero visibility of the attachment points and removal Is fast and non-damaging."</p><h2><strong>How long do they last?</strong></h2><p id=eAF4C3h-R9Ug data-wc=65>Tape in extensions are designed to be semi-permanent, meaning the hair has to be refitted every six to eight weeks. "With this application method, the hair you purchase is reusable," Louise says. "The quality of hair you choose, how often you wash your hair, and how you care for your hair will all determine how many times your new tape in extensions can be re-fitted."</p><h2><strong>Tape-in maintenance</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/portrait/f1c6233126ac-model-with-long-straight-hair.jpg><p id=etiW98ZBLqaB data-wc=28>&nbsp;As your hair naturally grows, the tapes will gravitate away from the scalp. During your maintenance appointment, the extensions will be removed and reapplied closer to the scalp.</p><p id=ewLtS5YSr_8o data-wc=18>To keep your hair looking luscious in the meantime, you may like to use a gentle, sulphate-free shampoo.</p><p id=e3Oqd4lUNY6s data-wc=57>It is important to note that you should not use excessive heat on your extensions. "While it’s completely fine to use dryers and straighteners, make sure not to apply heat directly to the tapes or bonds," Louise says. "Heat protection spray is also recommended to prevent heat damage to your extensions if you frequently use hair straighteners."&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Do tape-in extensions damage your hair?</strong></h2><p id=eUqMnnRBHvU8 data-wc=53>The process is not without risk, and if you have brittle or damaged hair, tape-ins may not be right for you. But when applied by an experienced hair extensionist, tape-ins should exact little to no damage on your natural hair. Do your research and find a reputable salon that offers a consultation beforehand.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfnbOue5Nybm1uZmTBorzEZqCnZZiWtrN5xLGrnqajnryvv44%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./beverly-kushida.html><span>←</span><span>Who is Beverly Kushida dating?
