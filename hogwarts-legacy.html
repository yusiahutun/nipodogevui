learn about the different plants and what they do.</span></p><p><span>The Herbology Class quest follows sometime after you have progressed in the game and will be a tutorial on how you can grow and use different plants.</span></p><p><span>This quest is one of your required classes to learn more about making ingredients that you will later need for making potions as well as other useful tools.</span></p><h2><b>How To Get Herbology Class?</b></h2><p><span>Once you have completed, </span><span><span><a href=#>Tomes and Tribulations quest</a></span>, the Herbology Class quest will be available along with other multiple quests at the same time.</span></p><h2><b>Herbology Class </b><b>Quest Walkthrough</b><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/progametalk.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/HLHECLA-2.png alt="Pulling Mandrake out of its current pot" width=624 height=352 data-sizes="(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></h2><p><span>The quest starts as a minigame cutscene where the class is learning about Mandrakes, which requires you to replant one.</span></p><h3><b>1) Pull Mandrake</b></h3><p><span>Once you are prompted to do so, you will need to hold the correct key/button prompted to pull the Mandrake out of its current pot.</span></p><h3><b>2) Repot Mandrake</b></h3><p><span>The Mandrakes in the classroom will go crazy and start screeching, which requires you quickly repot them in a larger pot.</span></p><p><span>You will be prompted once again with a movement function and will need to follow it to place the Mandrake into the pot.</span></p><h3><b>3) Talk to Professor Garlick</b></h3><p><span>Professor Garlick will finish the class and afterward, you will need to approach and speak to her, which begins another cutscene.</span></p><p><span>She will talk to you about planting a Dittany and to her surprise, you will already have the seeds, which you obtained previously, and will tell you to plant them.</span></p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/progametalk.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/HLHECLA-3.png alt="selecting the available seeds to begin planting" width=624 height=352 data-sizes="(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><h3><b>4) Plant the Dittany Seeds on the Potting Table</b></h3><p><span>The Potting Table will be nearby and you will need to interact with it to open up to view the seeds that you have available.</span></p><p><span>Select the Dittany Seeds and plant them to finish the task, which will show you how long you need to wait for them to grow.</span></p><p><span>Professor Garlick will congratulate you on successfully planting them and will suggest that you learn about another plant.</span></p><h3><b>5) Meet Leander Prewett</b></h3><p><span>She mentions that you will learn about the Chinese Chomping Cabbage and instructs you to meet with Leander Prewett who will take you to them.</span></p><p><span>Leander Prewett will be nearby and you will need to go over and talk to him before he shows you the way to the greenhouse where they are kept.</span></p><h3><b>6) Get to the Other Greenhouse</b></h3><p><span>Leander Prewett will greet you and tell you to go on ahead and that he will follow you, which won’t be a problem since the greenhouse is marked by a waypoint.</span></p><p><span>Make your way to the greenhouse and you will see that there are a lot of different plants that have already grown, including some Chinese Chomping Cabbages.</span></p><h3><b>7) Harvest Chinese Chomping Cabbage</b></h3><p><span>You will need to take at least one Chinese Chomping Cabbage, but it would be best to take everything you can get in the area.</span></p><p><span>If you are having trouble spotting the other plants that you can grab, you can cast Revelio to highlight them, making them easier to spot.</span></p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/progametalk.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/HLHECLA-4.png alt="Attack the target dummy with a Chomping Cabbage" width=624 height=352 data-sizes="(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><h3><b>8) Attack the Target Dummy with a Chomping Cabbage</b></h3><p><span>Now that you have some Chinese Chomping Cabbages, head over to the dummy and equip them in your tool slot.</span></p><p><span>Once tossed, the Chomping Cabbage will continue to attack the training dummy until it is destroyed, which will start a cutscene.</span></p><p><span>During the cutscene, Leander tells you more about the Chinese Chomping Cabbage and shortly leaves afterward.</span></p><h3><b>9) Return to Professor Garlick</b></h3><p><span>After speaking with Leander, head back to Professor Garlick to speak with her, which starts a cutscene that later ends with the quest being completed.</span></p><h2><b>Herbology Class Rewards</b></h2><p><span>After the Herbology Class quest has been completed, you will obtain 260 XP and will now have access to planting seeds and growing plants.</span></p><p><span>You can return anytime to visit your potted plants and later on will be able to do even more after progressing in the game.</span></p><h2><b>Verdict</b><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/progametalk.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/HLHECLA-5.png alt="Herbology Class quest complete" width=624 height=352 data-sizes="(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></h2><p><span>The lessons with the Mandrake were quite intense, especially since yours was more mature than the other ones but you handled it like a pro.</span></p><p><span>It turns out you may have a green thumb and it looks like you will need to get used to growing plants often if you want a good supply of resources.</span></p><p><span>While planting may be something that seems simple, this can come in handy later on when you want to brew potions and grow certain plants to use later.</span></p><p class=postsid
