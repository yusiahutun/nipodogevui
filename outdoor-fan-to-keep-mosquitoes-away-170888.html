Beyond creating a mosquito-free fortress, the best outdoor fans will also cool you down in the summer heat. That’s their intended purpose, after all.&nbsp;</p><p>This surprisingly low-tech solution works wonders because mosquitoes are weak fliers. All it takes is a gentle breeze from a medium-sized rotating fan to deter these <a href=# rel="dofollow noopener noreferrer">winged bloodsuckers</a>. The gusts of wind from the fan will also disperse the scent of carbon dioxide and other chemical cues that mosquitoes use to find their next meal.&nbsp;</p><p>This is not to say you should skip the <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" href=#>insect-repellant spray</a>, <a href=# rel=noopener>electric bug zappers</a>, and <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" href=#>citronella candles</a> — a combination of these methods makes the most sense. Also, the fan technique works best if you only need a small circle of protection. If you’re hosting a backyard barbecue for the neighborhood, you’re probably better off with traditional bug spray.</p><p>While there are more permanent solutions for getting rid of mosquitoes — like draining any stagnant bodies of water — an inexpensive outdoor fan is a great quick fix. We’ve rounded up some of our favorites, so you can get back to more important things, like sipping lemonade on your <a href=#>outdoor rocking chair</a>. <strong>Keep scrolling to shop our picks for the best outdoor fans to buy in 2021.</strong></p><h2 class=block-product__title><a href=# rel="noopener sponsored nofollow">Geek Aire Rechargeable 12-Inch Outdoor Floor High Velocity Fan</a></h2><span class=block-product__eyebrow>Best-seller Outdoor Fan</span> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2019/05/best-outdoor-oscillating-fan.jpg><p><a href=# rel="noopener sponsored nofollow"><strong>Buy from Amazon, $109.99 (was $139.99)</strong></a></p><h3 class=block-product-list__title>Why we like it:</h3><ul><li>Dual power supply</li><li>1250CFM high performance airflow</li><li>Stepless speed control</li><li>Vertical 360° rotation</li></ul><p><strong><a href=# rel="noopener sponsored nofollow">Geek Aire’s rechargeable outdoor fan</a></strong> is a bit smaller than the others mentioned but it comes with all the bells and whistles. It’s rechargeable, which means you don’t have to carry a tangled cord with you whenever you want to move it. This quiet fan comes with a handy LED battery gauge so you always know when it needs some juicing. The best part is the USB port on the side where you can charge your electronic devices.</p><p><strong>Happy customer: </strong>“Such a great product. I full-time RV 9 months of the year. One of the more expensive uses of energy while RV’ing is staying warm and staying cool. I love this fan because of its long lasting battery power and because if you need to turn it up and get a lot of air moving quickly this thing is ridiculous. But more than keeping cool this product is exceptional at moving air to stay warm during cool nights in the mountains or on the beach. I use it in conjunction with my portable heater because running your furnace will burn propane very quickly. The Geek Aire is so more economical to use with a small heating unit. You need to have the ability to move that warm air and this fan is the cat’s meow when it comes to moving air. When I don’t need the fan or when I’m outside of my RV I plug it into my solar power system to charge or directly into my generator and then it is good to go for another few days without worry. It’s definitely a product I would recommend anyone who loves the outdoors or just needs to move air quietly and comfortably.”</p><a class=block-product__cta href=#>Buy now<span class=block-product__cta-icon></span></a><h2 class=block-product__title><a href=# rel="noopener sponsored nofollow">B-Air FIRTANA-20X High Velocity Floor Fan, 20″</a></h2><span class=block-product__eyebrow>Best Outdoor Standing Fan</span> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2019/05/best-outdoor-standing-fan.jpg><p><a href=# rel="noopener sponsored nofollow"><strong>Buy from Amazon</strong></a>, <a href=# rel="noopener sponsored nofollow"><strong>$52.35</strong></a></p><h3 class=block-product-list__title>Why we like it:</h3><ul><li>3 speed settings</li><li>Tilt adjustable</li><li>Portable handle</li></ul><p><strong><a href=# rel="noopener sponsored nofollow">B-Air’s powerful 20-inch floor fan</a></strong> is a great basic option for any patio.

I have always owned the typical Walmart 20″ box fans and assumed that was how fans were. They work fine or so i thought. Case in point this Soleaire fan on low moves more air than a standard 20.00 box fan on high. The Soleaire fan on high…well its just crazy the amount of air.

Keep in mind, this outdoor fan can be a bit loud, according to Amazon shoppers. That said, the fan’s hum is calming white noise to some buyers. One woman described this fan as “the sort of fan that kids will fight to be in front of until a parent or grandparent comes in and barks at them to all go [sit down]. And it’s the sort of fan that a woman that hates heat like grim death wants.”</p><p><strong>Happy customer: </strong>“We bought two originally loved them so much bought two more.
