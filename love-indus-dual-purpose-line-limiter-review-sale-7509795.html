While I’m genetically fortunate in that I’ve always been mistaken for someone younger — which I loathed in my teens and early 20s and love now — <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>the lines</a> are still there.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Jumping on any opportunity as a shopping editor to test out products with the promise of diminishing those fine lines, I was intrigued when I received the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="nofollow nocaes">Freedom of Expression Dual-Purpose Line Limiter</a> from <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="nofollow nocaes">Love, Indus</a>. This blurring cream targets lip lines, laugh lines, and forehead creases all at the same time. I’ve always loved a multitasking time-saver that can give me both instant and long-term results (I’m ever so slightly impatient, after all). Since the product both covers and smooths lines immediately, and has properties to reduce their appearance over time, it seemed like a no-brainer and, I’m happy to report, truly works. And right now, you can save $15 on the Line Limiter and all Love, Indus products with code <strong>FREE15</strong>.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Love Indus</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_6-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Shop now:</strong> $73 with code <strong>FREE15</strong> (Originally $88); <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="nofollow nocaes">loveindus.com</a><br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The blurring cream comes out in a creamy brown color, which I apply using the cool metal applicator that’s also soothing on my skin. I place it above my upper lip to smooth out the vertical lines, by the corners of my mouth to the corners of my nose, and across my forehead. I use the applicator along with my fingertip to gently blend the product into my skin, which it does easily and without showing streaks or discoloration.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">From the first few uses, I noticed that the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="nofollow nocaes">Line Limiter</a> smoothed out and concealed my fine lines, which are not yet too deep, acting as a concealer for signs of aging. And, as a bonus, I’ve discovered that I can use the cream each morning as a long-lasting primer before applying makeup.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">What’s most beneficial about the blurring cream is that while it smooths and conceals lines for the short term, using the product regularly helps to soften lines over time, too. The <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="nofollow nocaes">Line Limiter</a> is formulated with botanical ingredients — contributing to its fresh floral scent — including lotus flower extract to keep the skin firm, antioxidant-rich mulberry to brighten the skin, senna to hydrate and boost collagen, vegan collagen to increase elasticity, and more, according to the brand. Within a few weeks, I noticed my lines were subtly less deep, and that my skin had a tighter appearance.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Shoppers found similar results with diminishing lines, with one person sharing that after using it for “a while” they “think [they] just found a magic eraser for [their] smile lines.” Another shopper who gets botox and uses the Line Limiter “day and night” said that it’s “perfect for in-between appointments” because it “visibly blurs fine lines.” Concerned with the vertical lines above their lips, a third reviewer called it an “amazing product” while adding that their “lines are literally disappearing in front of [their] eyes” after a month’s use.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Whether you need a quick fix for fine lines if you’re heading out for a special occasion or want to see long-term smoothing results, the Love, Indus <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="nofollow nocaes">Freedom of Expression Dual-Purpose Line Limiter</a> can help you blur those lines.
