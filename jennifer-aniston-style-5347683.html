Her leggy, red carpet dresses consistently turn heads, her jeans and T-shirts always seem casual-cool, and her go-to wedges have sent us on our own personal shopping sprees. In short, the Emmy award-winning actress's style can't be beaten — and even the looks she wore in the '90s serve as modern-day outfit inspiration.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Part of this is because when Aniston likes something, she really likes it and wears it on repeat —sometimes even for decades. Looking back at <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>the Friends alum's best fashion moments</a>, we've realized that she sticks to the same styling hacks and tricks, which we've rounded up, ahead.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Keep scrolling for Jennifer Aniston's fashion rulebook.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-invest-in-a-pair-of-wedges></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Invest in a Pair of Wedges</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Getty Images</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">While some people love white sneakers or sexy stilettos, Aniston's go-to shoe is a pair of wedges. She's been wearing this style for years, breaking it out for both casual outings and red carpet appearances, and convincing us that these babies pair well with everything.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-go-beyond-your-trusty-denim></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Go Beyond Your Trusty Denim</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Getty Images</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Jeans are cool and all, but according to Aniston's outfits, olive green cargo pants are worthy competitors. They're still neutral and versatile and look great with all the basics in our closet — but they add a slight pop of color.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-leather-isnt-just-for-jackets></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Leather Isn't Just For Jackets</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Getty Images</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_17-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Many of us have motorcycle somethings tucked away in our closet, but the actress is a fan of leather dresses and pants, too. (A little ode to her onscreen love, Ross Gellar, perhaps?) She even wore a longer, duster-style jacket back in the '90s, making quite The Matrix-y statement.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-hats-will-give-any-outfit-a-boost></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_19-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Hats Will Give Any Outfit a Boost</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_20-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Getty Images</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_21-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Perhaps she's hoping to avoid the sun. Maybe she's shielding herself from prying paparazzi. Or maybe Aniston just knows a fedora can give casual outfits a little extra oomph. She frequently gives her look a laid-back, boho vibe with this type of addition, and over the years, has developed quite the hat collection.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-scarves-work-for-every-season></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_23-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Scarves Work For Every Season</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_24-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Getty Images</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_25-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">While a scarf is no doubt a practical accessory for winter, a lighter version can make summer outfits more interesting. The actress is known for pulling this styling trick since her Friends days.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-find-your-signature-fit></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_27-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Find Your Signature Fit</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_28-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Getty Images</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_29-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Sure, Aniston loves a boot-cut jean, but she also has a ton of baggier pants in rotation. When she opts to wear boyfriend jeans, she keeps her outfits simple and slim-fitting on top, playing with proportions. Plus, as the pictures show, she cuffs the bottoms and lets her ankles peek out — a classic, elongating trick.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-stock-up-on-white-tees></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_31-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Stock Up on White Tees</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_32-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Getty Images</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_33-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">It's hard to think of an outfit that won't work with a white tee. This staple looks great with denim, skirts, sweats, and suits. Plus, we'll never forget when Selena Gomez embraced the '90s Friends style and layered one under her jumpsuit.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-when-in-doubt-grab-a-button-down-shirt></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_35-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>When in Doubt, Grab a Button-Down Shirt</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_36-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Getty Images</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_37-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Of course, when a T-shirt seems too casual for what you've got going on, a button-down shirt can easily take its place. The Morning Show star has worn her fair share on the red carpet and occasionally goes for an all-black look, which is always super sleek.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-a-structured-blazer-is-extremely-versatile></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_39-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>A Structured Blazer Is Extremely Versatile</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_40-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Getty Images</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_41-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Every so often, we face the same dilemma: what kind of jacket to wear when denim doesn't work — leather seems too casual, and the weather's too warm for something furry. The answer is a blazer, one of Aniston's favorites. She has used a blazer to make simple pairings seem more polished, and has even worn it over fancy dresses.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-string-bikinis-are-the-ultimate-vacation-staple></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_43-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>String Bikinis Are the Ultimate Vacation Staple</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_44-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Splash News</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_45-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Nothing gives off vacation vibes like hitting the beach in an itty-bitty string bikini. This swimwear is versatile and sexy, making it forever stylish — no wonder Aniston is a fan.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-a-black-crossbody-bag-makes-a-great-everyday-option></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_47-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>A Black Crossbody Bag Makes a Great Everyday Option</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_48-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Getty Images</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_49-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Stylish and practical, black crossbody bags are a constant in Aniston's accessory collection. Not only does the color mean you can reach for it any day of the week, but it's also easy and hands-free for those of us who are always on the run. Take another tip from the star and go with a safe, medium size so you can fit more stuff.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-pendant-necklaces-make-any-outfit-more-interesting></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_51-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Pendant Necklaces Make Any Outfit More Interesting</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_52-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Getty Images</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_53-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">It's pretty much guaranteed that if you find the perfect pendant necklace, you'll start pairing it with all your outfits, from the office-appropriate ones to your throw-on-and-go looks. The Murder Mystery co-star is a prime example of this.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-aviator-sunglasses-are-timeless></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_55-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Aviator Sunglasses Are Timeless</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_56-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Getty Images</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_57-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Despite the different&nbsp;sunglass trends&nbsp;that are out there — tiny sunglasses, cat-eyes, etc. — aviators continue to remain Aniston's favorite. They're universally flattering, never go out of style, and give off an edge. You really can't go wrong.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-long-black-dresses-work-for-any-fancy-occasion></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_59-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Long Black Dresses Work for Any Fancy Occasion</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_60-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Getty Images</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_61-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">For those who have a ton of weddings and formal events on their calendar, do as Aniston does and make sure you have a long, black dress handy. This no-fail option has helped her rule the red carpet for years, and, for us normal folks, it can always be worn again.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57yZ6lp6GWmr9urc2iqq2nnmLAtcXLnmRua2Rsg3l%2F</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./hawkeyes-announce-social-distancing-guidelines-at-kinnick-stadium.html><span>←</span><span>Hawkeyes announce social distancing guidelines at Kinnick Stadium</span></a>
