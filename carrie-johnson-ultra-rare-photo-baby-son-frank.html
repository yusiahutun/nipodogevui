In terms of decor, Carrie has opted for the most cosy but luxurious soft furnishings including, frilly cushion covers and matching lampshades, hardwood floors, and ornate mirrors.</p><p id=e5xr5E6SrcX data-wc=59>Earlier this month, Carrie shared a glimpse of her homely country kitchen when she posted a video showing a flock of chicks joining her and her three children for tea. The details of the family space boasted white cupboards with a wooden work surface, off-white chairs with orange and cream seats, and a sage green tablecloth emblazoned with ducks.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/372e42f90b63-carrie-johnson-baby-sleeping.jpg><p id=eDwsePg10eB data-wc=45>One week after she and Boris welcomed little Frankie back in July, Carrie shared a slew of photos from her and Boris' stunning bedroom. In the images, the doting mother could be seen cradling her newborn whilst poised on her cosy dark mahogany bed frame.</p><p id=ePBwmmCbyep data-wc=42>On top of the crisp white bedding was a slew of cream and white decorative cushions that perfectly matched the lampshade sitting on the bedside table. The lamp itself was made of china and was decorated with an intricate royal blue design.</p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
