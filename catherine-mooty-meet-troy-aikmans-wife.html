<span>Jenniffer Sheldon</span></p><h1>Catherine Mooty: Meet Troy Aikman's Wife</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>Catherine Mooty is a businesswoman and an entrepreneur in the fashion industry. She is the co-founder of Luxeliner, a premium fashion retail line. However, she gained recognition after her marriage to Troy Aikman became public. Troy Aikman is a former American Quarterback who played in the NFL for 12 seasons with the Dallas Cowboys.&nbsp;</p><p>Following his retirement in 2000, Aikman became a commentator for NFL on FOX from 2001-2021 and has served as the commentator of Monday Night Live since 2022. Since the rumors about Aikman’s infidelity leaked, the media has been curious about who Catherine Mooty is.</p><p>Here’s everything we know about her.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Who_Is_Troy_Aikmans_Wife></span>Who Is Troy Aikman’s Wife?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Catherine Capa Mooty was born on October 13, 1970, in Dallas, Texas, USA. Although there are no details about Mooty’s early life, reports suggest she grew up in Dallas. The identity of her parents is unknown, along with that of her siblings. However, several reports show she grew up with her parents and siblings.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Additionally, there are no details regarding her elementary and high school education. However, following her graduation from high school, Mooty enrolled at the University of Texas, where she eventually graduated with a Bachelor’s degree in Marketing.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/fotor_2023-6-12_9_39_36.jpg><p>After graduating from the University of Texas, she started her career in the fashion industry. Catherine Mooty began by working in sales and marketing for fashion brands. Some years later, she founded her luxury fashion retail line, Luxeliner, with her friend, Charlotte Jones Anderson.&nbsp;</p><p>The brand specializes in creating high-end, travel-inspired apparel for women. Mooty’s clothing line is popular for its high-quality designs, use of luxury fabrics, and attention to detail. The brand’s collection features travel pieces that are comfortable and classy. The brand has been featured in several publications, including Vogue, and has dressed celebrities, including Gwyneth Paltrow and Jennifer Aniston.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=When_Did_Catherine_Mooty_and_Troy_Aikman_Meet></span>When Did Catherine Mooty and Troy Aikman Meet?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Mooty met the man who would later become her husband in 2016. It was love at first sight for the pair, and they hit it off. Although the date they became official is a mystery, they announced their engagement the following year. Their love blossomed rapidly, and the lovebirds tied the knot that year.&nbsp;</p><p>The couple had a lavish wedding ceremony on September 1, 2017. They exchanged vows at the Biltmore Four Seasons in Montecito, California. Even though they were both previously married to other people, it was another chance at love for them, and their wedding had family and friends in attendance.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/fotor_2023-6-12_9_39_0.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=How_Many_Kids_Do_Catherine_Mooty_and_Troy_Aikman_Have></span>How Many Kids Do Catherine Mooty and Troy Aikman Have?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>While the couple does not have children together yet, they have four kids from their previous marriages. Aikman has two daughters, Jordan Ashley, and Alexa Marie, from his last marriage to Rhonda Worthey. Aikman and his first wife separated after a decade of being together, after which he met his second wife.</p><p>On the other hand, Catherine Mooty also has two kids, Luke and Valentina, from her previous marriage to Lawyer Jerry Mooty. The now-divorced couple exchanged vows in 1990 and parted ways several years later.&nbsp;</p><p>After walking down the aisle with the retired NFL player, they became a blended family of six. Aikman and Mooty’s four children all spend quality time with their parents. The family goes on outdoor excursions and trips together.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Are_Catherine_Mooty_and_Troy_Aikman_Divorced></span>Are Catherine Mooty and Troy Aikman Divorced?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>While rumors of their split still exist, they are still today, albeit on what appears to be a shaky foundation. The couple appeared to be doing well, at least fans thought so, until June 7, 2023, when the retired NFL player sparked dating rumors.</p><p>His rumored girlfriend, Haley Clark, posted pictures of her and <a href=#>Troy Aikman</a> vacationing in Europe on Instagram. In the now-deleted photos, Aikman and Clark were both in their swimsuits, and the pair exchanged affection as they kissed.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/fotor_2023-6-12_9_35_57.jpg><p>The pictures made the media frenzy, and Clark has since set her Instagram account to private. The images gave credence to the reports that Aikman and Mooty are no longer together and have secretly filed for divorce. However, these reports are unverified, and the couple are yet to confirm the separation rumors.&nbsp;</p><p>Although whether Aikman and Mooty have called it quits is unknown, they have not flaunted each other on social media in recent years. Catherine Mooty still has Aikman as her last name on Instagram. However, it is unclear where the couple stands.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Catherine_Mootys_Net_Worth></span>Catherine Mooty’s Net Worth<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The fashion entrepreneur has made a name for herself in the fashion industry and reportedly has a net worth of $3 million. The retired NFL star’s wife amassed her wealth from her career as the co-founder of a clothing line. However, her husband has an estimated net worth of $65 million, which he made through his long career as an athlete and a sports commentator.&nbsp;</p><p>While there seems to be trouble in paradise, fans hope Mooty and Aikman’s marriage will survive and not end in divorce like that of <a href=#>Dallas Yokum and Mike Lindell</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifmajBp7HSrWWcp51ksKLAx56poqaVYrqwu9OyZKadlal6tb7OsmSaoZuirq%2B%2FjLCgn51f</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./hair-dye-and-breast-cancer-risk-220416-lift3.html><span>←</span><span></span></a>
