[] El sitio conocido como el lugar santísimo, era el área más oculta y más sagrada del antiguo tabernáculo de Moisés y del templo de Jerusalén. El lugar santísimo fue construido como un cubo perfecto. Sólo contenía el arca del pacto, el símbolo de la relación especial de Israel con Dios. Únicamente el sumo sacerdote israelita podía acceder al lugar santísimo. Una vez al año, en Yom Kipur, el día de la expiación, el sumo sacerdote estaba autorizado para entrar en el pequeño recinto, sin ventanas para quemar incienso y rociar la sangre de un animal sacrificado sobre el propiciatorio del arca.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Surprise!
