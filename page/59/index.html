Like many women before me, I found myself single in my early 30s and, for the first time in my life, started to consider my biological clock. It wasn’t ticking that loudly, but there was a niggle in my psyche to have a fertility check-up just to affirm I had many years ahead of me. I had read so many stories of people having babies in their 40s, I wasn’t worried; this was more for peace of mind.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Who are Tyler Adamss Parents?
