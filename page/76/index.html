No hard feelings. Matty Healy is reportedly okay with the release of Taylor Swift‘s Tortured Poet’s Department. The Lover and Being Funny In A Foreign Language artists dated briefly in 2023, and some songs on Swift’s new album allude to their relationship. On April 24, 2024, Healy was stopped by a reporter who asked, “How would you rate your Taylor diss track compared to the 30 others?” In a video obtained by Entertainment Tonight, the singer looked confused at first asking “My diss track?</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Moline makes changes to right turns on 41st street to improve safety</h2><time>Jun 2, 2024</time>

Traffic on 41st Street in Moline heading to John Deere Road will be restricted to no turns on red lights for right-hand turns, starting March 11. The city will use LED message boards, media advisories and social media alerts on their platforms to get the word out.
Why the change? According to a news release from the city, the Moline Police Department has seen a 140% increase in traffic crashes at this intersection since 2018.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>No, a MagSafe Case Won't Break Your Galaxy S24 Ultra's S Pen</h2><time>Jun 2, 2024</time>

Now that the Qi2 standard is finalized, some new Android phones will be compatible with Apple's MagSafe technology. But the Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra doesn't support Qi2 charging. If you want to pair your Galaxy S24 Ultra with a MagSafe accessory, you need a MagSafe case—this may reduce S Pen performance, but the effect is mostly negligible.

<a href=../../the-meaning-of-door-to-the-river-by-willem-de-kooning.html></a>
Willem de Kooning's painting "Door to the River" is a striking and thought-provoking piece that captures the essence of movement and emotion. The abstract composition, with its fluid lines and vibrant colors, seems to depict a doorway leading to a river. The door, situated at the center of the painting, acts as a threshold between two worlds - the known and the unknown, the tangible and the ever-changing.At first glance, the painting may be interpreted as a representation of transition and transformation.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>What happened to Mike Tyson's daughter?

September 28, 2022 That’s what our new Tesla sounds like. They finally… gave in, I’d call it… and gave us our Tesla last Friday. It’s been delay after delay. The actual problem as it turns out is that it emits a tone, to put it mildly. I didn’t notice it at first in the car lot with the typical road noise nearby.

However, ahem, I do purchase a few kitchen-related items each year and thought I’d mention some of the standouts from 2016. [Here’s 2015’s list, all still in heavy rotation.] Most are remarkably basic, either because I had necessities to replace (coughclumsy) but a lot are simple just because I’m incredibly stubborn and it really has taken me this long to buy a second set of measuring cups and spoons, some aprons and a coffee-making apparatus.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Find out about law enforcement jobs at Moline fair</h2><time>Jun 1, 2024</time>
