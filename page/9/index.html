<a href=../../dinosaur-hair-and-ribbons-has-scientists-enthralled.html></a>
About 110 million years ago, along the shores of an ancient lagoon in what is now northeastern Brazil, a two-legged chicken-sized Cretaceous Period dinosaur made a living hunting insects and perhaps small vertebrates like frogs and lizards.
On the inside, it was ordinary, with a skeleton similar to many small dinosaurs from the preceding Jurassic Period, scientists said on Tuesday. On the outside, it was anything but.
This dinosaur, called Ubirajara jubatus, possessed a mane of hairlike structures while also boasting two utterly unique, stiff, ribbonlike features probably made of keratin – the same substance that makes up hair and fingernails – protruding from its shoulders.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Florida hospital under fire after harrowing doc reveals Maya and Beata Kowalski's story</h2><time>Sep 24, 2024</time>

A Florida hospital has come under fire after the harrowing details of a teen who claims she was 'held captive' by them in 2016&nbsp;surfaced in a Netflix documentary.
Maya Kowalski, now 17, was placed into state custody for three months after doctors accused her parents of faking symptoms of her debilitating&nbsp;complex regional pain syndrome (CPRS).
The feature revealed that hospital staff called child services twice to falsely accuse Maya's mother Beata of&nbsp;Munchausen-by-proxy (MSP) - a mental illness and a form of child abuse in which the caretaker of a child, most often a mother, either makes up fake symptoms or causes real symptoms to make it look like the child is sick.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Hiking Shoes Made For Stripping?</h2><time>Sep 24, 2024</time>
