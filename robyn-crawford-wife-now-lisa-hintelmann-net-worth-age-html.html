How did she cope with the loss? Read along to learn what she's doing now!</p><h2 style=text-align:justify>What Is Robyn Crawford Doing Now?</h2><p style=text-align:justify>As of now, Robyn is one half of openly gay marriage and maintains a loving family with her wife. But, it would not have been&nbsp;possible if she hadn't discontinued her personal & professional relationship with Whitney Houston. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-607 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p style=text-align:justify>After&nbsp;Whitney had signed a&nbsp;record deal, Robyn began working&nbsp;as her assistant. Following a fallout with the I Will Always Love You singer's husband Bobby Brown in 2000, she quit the gig.</p><p style=text-align:justify><strong>Whitney & Bobby's Daughter:-</strong>&nbsp;<a href=# title="Bobbi Kristina Brown's Death Marks Two Years!

Robyn met Lisa Hintelmann. Soon after,&nbsp;the lovebirds began living together and eventually got married. By adopting twins, they further solidified their ever-so-growing&nbsp;bond. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-608 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><p style=text-align:justify></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p style=text-align:justify><strong>Robyn Crawford with wife Lisa Hintelmann with their children circa 2016</strong> (Photo:- Robyn Crawford's Facebook)</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><p style=text-align:justify>Robyn's wife Lisa is the head of Talent and Entertainment Partnerships at Audible, Inc.

The Bodyguard and Waiting To Exhale - both starring Whitney - are some of her notable works as a miscellaneous crew. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-611 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p style=text-align:justify>In 1997, she earned her first producer credit in the TV series The Wonderful World of Disney.</p><p style=text-align:justify><strong>Lesbian Partner Of Famous Celeb:-</strong>&nbsp;<a href=# title="Cydney Bernard Girlfriend, Net Worth, Family, Now" rel=follow>Cydney Bernard Girlfriend, Net Worth, Family, Now</a></p><p style=text-align:justify>Robyn also provided an in-depth commentary on&nbsp;Whitney: Can I Be Me, a 2017 documentary which shed light on the late singer's bisexuality.

In contrast, Whitney's estate inherited&nbsp;$40 million fortune after her death. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p style=text-align:justify>With regards to Robyn's education, there seems to be no record of her schooling. Nobody knows if she even attended college.</p><h2 style=text-align:justify>Family Background, Age & Birthday</h2><p style=text-align:justify>Robyn's family background is equally elusive. Questions about her parents and siblings continue to evade the public domain.</p><p style=text-align:justify><strong>Related To Whitney:-&nbsp;</strong><a href=# rel=follow>Alicia Etheredge Age, Net Worth, Husband, Now&nbsp;</a></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p style=text-align:justify>Because she and her late best friend Whitney were friends as kids, they were likely of the same age.
