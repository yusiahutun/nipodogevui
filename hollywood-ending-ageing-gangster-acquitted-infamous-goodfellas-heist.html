Kennedy International Airport. There was no statute of limitations on charges in the indictment because of the rules of federal racketeering laws.<img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/486w/public/images/methode/2015/11/13/7ae2622c-89a8-11e5-9598-b94cb5b90839_486x.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">At the time it occurred, the heist was the biggest in US history, and it inspired Martin Scorsese’s film Goodfellas. The perpetrators got away with about US$6 million in cash and jewels, most of which never was recovered.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The prosecution’s case hinged on whether jurors believed the testimony of witnesses who linked Asaro to the holdup and other crimes but who were longtime mobsters with criminal histories.</p>They included Asaro’s cousin Gaspare Valenti and Peter “Bud” Zuccaro, who had cooperated with federal authorities in exchange for money and possible leniency from prosecutors. Valenti and Zuccaro are in a witness protection programme.<img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/486w/public/images/methode/2015/11/13/80610ba4-89a8-11e5-9598-b94cb5b90839_486x.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Their years of secret recordings helped investigators charge Asaro, a member of New York’s Bonanno crime family. The 26-page indictment alleged a litany of crimes, including the strangulation of a suspected snitch whose body was buried beneath the floor of another mobster’s home, use of threats to squeeze money from debtors and involvement in the Lufthansa robbery.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">When the jury, whose first full day of deliberations was Tuesday, announced its verdict, Asaro appeared not to hear, and he looked briefly confused. But the hawk-nosed, usually sour-faced defendant broke into a broad grin when a member of his defence team told him he was acquitted, and he slapped his hands on the table in triumph.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Asaro was not portrayed in Goodfellas, but prosecutors said he helped organise the Lufthansa holdup and was in a decoy car that was to be used to divert police if officers arrived on the scene.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Asaro, who seethed with anger during some prosecution witnesses’ testimony, was only the second person to be charged in the heist. The first was a Lufthansa employee who was convicted in 1979 of providing the robbers with inside information.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Valenti testified that Asaro was friends with the crime’s chief organiser, James “Jimmy the Gent” Burke of the Lucchese crime family. Burke, the inspiration for Robert De Niro’s character in Goodfellas, died of lung cancer while in prison in 1996 for murder and other crimes, which did not include the Lufthansa holdup. Valenti and Zuccaro were not depicted in the film.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In his testimony, Valenti said Asaro told him that Burke “had a big score” coming up and that Valenti could be part of the gang.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The defence accused Valenti, Zuccaro and other government informants of lying to save their own skins. Valenti and Zuccaro both admitted to being longtime organised crime members who had gambled away their fortunes.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51ku6bD0miuqKqcmXyivtOimqWdX2aFeISTa2looJ%2BhubrDzqibZp2embavs4yanp6hnpx6qK3NoKqtnaJirqS91KKrrZ2UYravssCmpq6rXZy8sLDFnqOlmaNitaa10q0%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./gracie-dzienny.html><span>←</span><span>Gracie Dzienny</span></a>
