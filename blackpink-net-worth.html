When you’re done, return to this article. Congratulations, you’re a BLINK. <a href=# rel=noopener>BLACKPINK’s net worth</a> is no joke. As one of the most popular girl groups in the world, Jennie, Lisa, Rosé and Jisoo have more money than you and I. Times a thousand. But how rich are the members of BLACKPINK? And are Jennie, Lisa, Rosé and Jisoo paid the same? Let us investigate!</p><p>BLACKPINK debuted in 2016 with their first single, “Boombayah.” Since then, YG Entertainment’s four-member girl group has become one of the most well-known bands in K-pop—not to mention the world. In 2019, they became the first K-pop act to <a href=# rel=noopener>perform at Coachella</a>. They’ve also released music with Dua Lipa, Lady Gaga, Selena Gomez and Cardi B. &nbsp;So, yeah, if you aren’t on the BLACKPINK train yet, you better hop on. They released their first studio album The Album in 2020 to high acclaim with songs like “How You Like That” and “Crazy Over You.” This year, they released their second studio album, <a href=# rel=noopener>Born Pink</a>,&nbsp;featuring their long-awaited comeback singles “Shut Down” and&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener>“Pink Venom.”</a></p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/487C7E72-3404-4BBA-A3DD-CC1272B4AFBD.png> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/rita-ora-net-worth.jpg><p>In an interview for their <a href=# rel=noopener>cover story for Rolling Stone</a>, Jennie said, “Even if we’re 70 and we have different lives, I’ll still feel like I’m Blackpink,” says Jennie. “As corny as it sounds, I don’t think Blackpink will ever end in my heart. It’s a part of my family. You can’t deny your family.” The quartet was also just awarded TIME Entertainers of the Year for 2022, making them the first K-Pop Girl Group to grace the cover of the iconic magazine. While talking to the magazine, Jennie also said, “We put in a lot of work so we could look like superwomen. We’re very normal girls, at the end of the day.”</p><p>According to WealthyPersons.com, BLACKPINK’s <a href=# id=auto-tag_net-worth data-tag=net-worth>net worth</a> as a whole is around $24 million a year, which would mean each of the members would take home $6 million. Let’s see how rich these ladies really are and read below to see how much the BLACKPINK member’s net worths are worth.</p><h2>What is BLACKPINK’s Jennie’s net worth?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/blackpink-jennie-.jpg><p>What is Jennie’s net worth? According to <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Celebrity Net Worth</a>, Jennie’s net worth is estimated to be around $20 million. Several sources say that BLACKPINK’s members are paid the same for the music they release and the performances they do as a band. However, the members’ net worths do differ a little based on their different brand deals. According to WealthyPersons.com, BLACKPINK’s net worth as a whole is around $24 million a year, which would mean each of the members would take home $6 million. That number, however, is likely a little lower based on the cut that BLACKPINK’s management company, YG Entertainment, takes out of the band’s profits. Along with BLACKPINK’s music and performances, Jennie has also been a brand ambassador for Chanel, as well as for the beauty brand, Hera, and collaborated with sunglasses brand Gentle Monster. The singer and rapper dropped her single, “Solo,” in 2018.</p><h2>What is BLACKPINK’s Lisa’s net worth?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/lisa-blackpink.jpg><p>What is Lisa’s net worth? Lisa’s net worth is also likely around $20 million according to <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Celebrity Net Worth</a> and based on the $25 million that BLACKPINK makes each year, plus the cash from her other sponsorships. Though, as we mentioned earlier, the figure is likely a little lower because of the cut that YG Entertainment takes out of BLACKPINK’s paychecks. Along with her work with BLACKPINK, has also been a brand ambassador for the cosmetics company Moonshot. She’s also signed endorsement deals with companies like Adidas, AIS Thailand, Penshoppe and Samsung (which the other BLACKPINK members are also partners with). In 2021, she was named the global brand ambassador for the Celine Haute Parfumerie collection and walked in its summer 2022 show in Nice, France. Given her endorsement deals, Lisa likely makes, even more, a year than the $6 million she earns just on BLACKPINK’s music. In 2021, Lisa also had her solo debut hits “Money” and “LaLisa” which the former peaked at number ten on the Billboard Global 200. Like her song, she’s here to “drop some money.”</p><h2>What is BLACKPINK’s Rosé’s net worth?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/blackpink-rose.jpg><p>What is Rosé’s net worth? Like Lisa and Jennie, Rosé’s net worth is $20 million according to <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Celebrity Net Worth</a> and based on the $25 million that BLACKPINK makes each year, with the addition of her other jobs. There’s a chance the figure is a little lower than that because of the cut YG Entertainment takes, but Rosie likely makes that money back through her endorsement deals. Along with Jisoo, Rosie is also an ambassador for the cosmetic brand Kiss Me. She’s also signed an endorsement deal with Perfect World Mobile, a game by Perfect World Entertainment. But perhaps Rosie’s most high-profile deal is as a brand ambassador for Yves Saint Laurent. Rosé became the muse for Yves Saint Laurent Beauté in 2020. She became one of the first K-pop stars, alongside rapper CL, to attend the Met Gala in 2021, wearing Saint Laurent and walking alongside its creative director Anthony Vaccarello. She was also revealed as Tiffany & Co’s newest global ambassador, debuting in the 2021 Tiffany HardWear digital campaign. In March 2021, she also made her solo single album debut with R, which features the songs “On the Ground” and “Gone/”</p><h2>What is BLACKPINK’s Jisoo’s net worth?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/blackpink-jisoo-1.jpg><p>What is Jisoo’s net worth? Jisoo’s net worth is also likely around $20 million according to <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Celebrity Net Worth</a> and based on how BLACKPINK evenly split their yearly $25 million earnings, plus her other money-making opportunities. The $6 million is estimated, though, as BLACKPINK’s management company, YG Entertainment, is expected to take a percentage of their salary. Still, like the other members, Jisoo has her own brand deals to make cash outside of BLACKPINK. Along with Rosie, she’s the face of the South Korean cosmetics brand Kiss Me. Jisoo also is an ambassador for Dior Beauty and was named a brand ambassador for the French luxury fashion house in March 2021. In May of the same year, Cartier revealed that Jisoo had joined the Panthère community as a spokesperson, alongside the likes of stars such as Emma Chamberlain, Austin Butler, Ella Balinska and more.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Born-Pink-BLACKPINK.jpg><p><span class="_text_y7yck_1 _text_153t8_1" data-component=text data-alias data-alignment data-theme=product-price data-transform data-truncate>$42</span><span class="_text_y7yck_1 _text_153t8_1" data-component=text data-alias=buy-now__original-price data-alignment data-theme=product-price-strikethrough data-transform data-truncate>$49.98</span><span class="_text_y7yck_1 _text_153t8_1" data-component=text data-alias data-alignment data-theme=product-percentage-off data-transform data-truncate>16% Off</span></p><p><a href=# rel=noopener><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Watch-This-Space.png alt='"Watch This Space" - Amazon Prime Video' width=670 height=155 sizes="(max-width: 670px) 100vw, 670px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><p>Our mission at STYLECASTER is to bring style to the people, and we only feature products we think you’ll love as much as we do.
