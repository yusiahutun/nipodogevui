There are houses being built on two neighbour sites, what's to stop them opening another and another?</p><p>"The roads are in a poor enough condition as it is, but with all these houses coming that's going to get much worse. I don't see how the village school can cope with such an influx either.</p><p>"It was a very sad day for the village and the area when these plans were passed."</p><p>The plans received 45 objections from local residents, citing<br>over-development and the impact on schools and other local facilities.</p><p>Thropton Parish Council also objected and said it would be a<br>"disproportionate increase in the size of the village".</p><p>The parish council's objection added: "The appearance of the housing is of great concern as we have a responsibility for the future to ensure that what makes Northumberland scenic and attractive to visitors is maintained.

I think in many ways it will bring new life into the village and probably a lot of younger people.</p><p>"So from a business point of view I'm very happy to support the development."</p><p>He stops and looks round at a Northumbria Water worker carrying out an inspection of the village's drains.</p><p>George continued: "But when you look at the drains and the roads and the school it does make you wonder how much pressure that many people coming into the village will place on the infrastructure. It's a lot of people."</p><p>Author Tom Dean, 91, is also happy with the plans, admitting: "Nowhere can stay exactly the same forever.</p><p>"This is a lovely village in a beautiful part of the world and to have some new and maybe younger people here can't be a bad thing to my mind."</p><p>Stewart Rogers, 75, is a partner with Valley View Developments, the company which obtained planning permission on behalf of the owner of the land.</p><p>He says builders will be breaking ground on the site as early as May this year and admits the plan has been divisive.</p><p>This is a lovely village in a beautiful part of the world and to have some new and maybe younger people here can't be a bad thing to my mind</p><span class=quote-credit>Tom Dean, local author</span><p>Mr Rogers says: "I've come in for quite a bit of flak myself and I<br>know this has not been popular with some people around this village.</p><p>"But if you are someone who would rather see young people leave the village than have the view from your living room window spoiled, then something is surely wrong.</p><p>"We need to provide affordable housing for young people and villages likes this one can't simply stay the same, with its population getting older and older.</p><p>"There has to be change and new life and new people to keep villages like Thropton thriving for the next generation."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/4176955c-ff27-4f08-be96-496f9cf0ba50.jpg><p>A spokesperson for Northumberland County Council said: “Supporting the delivery of new affordable homes is a key priority for the Council. Given the rural nature of much of Northumberland, all development sites make a valuable contribution to the delivery of a choice and mix of housing.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>“The principle of developing this site on the edge of Thropton for approximately 60 dwellings was granted planning permission in 2015.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>“After detailed negotiations with the developer, we were satisfied that issues like access, housing design, landscaping and scale were acceptable. The proposals were considered sustainable, and the detailed scheme for 65 dwellings including 15 affordable homes was approved in October 2022.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>“We believe it will provide high quality housing that will help grow the local community of Thropton and contribute to meeting housing needs across the Mid-Coquetdale Neighbourhood Plan area.”</p><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">Village link to hit detective show</h3></p><img alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/vera.jpg><p class=article__content--intro>The picturesque views around Thropton featured in detective show Vera.</p><p>The hamlet’s neighbouring village of Rothbury was used in a series two episode called Silent Voices in which a social worker drowned.</p><p>Vera producer Margaret Mitchell said she was struck by the views around Rothbury - where the news homes will now be built.</p><p>She says: “This is where we filmed the wild water swimmer.</p><p>“We arrived very early in the morning, on an October day when it was very misty.
