Speaking to EW about the situation at the time, Stana said: “I'm actually still not clear on the thought process behind the way that it went down. It hurt and it was a harsh ending, but now, nearly two years later…I met so many beautiful people on that project, and we collaborated on something really unique in that it's not every day that you get a show, or a series, that has eight seasons and that it was a hit for the network.&nbsp;</p><p id=e_YY6SeYWIVh data-wc=61>“It would be a disservice to those people, to the work that we did together, and to my work, which I feel contributed, in part, to the success of the show, to be anything but grateful… I can't be anything but glad that I was a part of something like that.
