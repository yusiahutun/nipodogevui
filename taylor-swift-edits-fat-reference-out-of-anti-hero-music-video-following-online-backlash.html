She admitted that there have been a few times where she'd see paparazzi photos of herself "where I feel like I looked like my tummy was too big, or… someone said that I looked pregnant … and that'll just trigger me to just starve a little bit — just stop eating." Swift says that her disordered eating patterns would "only [happen] a few times, and I'm not in any way proud of it."</p><p>She shared that the starvation and weight loss began affecting the singer's ability to perform while on her "1989" tour, as she said she "thought that I was supposed to feel like I was going to pass out at the end of the show, or in the middle of it."</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:a720dddb-10bd-4be2-b36e-a2517f4718cc data-container-ref=toofab:article:197a0588-e20a-4b71-b54c-e46fa54e9483 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/3a/5by4/2022/10/25/3a52ef3d7fbb42d986f7e34904443c06_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Penn Badgley Recreates Taylor Swift's Anti-Hero TikTok Challenge as 'You' Character</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>If anyone would express concern over her frail, double-zero frame, she would say: "What are you talking about? Of course I eat...I exercise a lot." She admitted that she "did exercise a lot, but I wasn't eating."</p><p>"If you're thin enough then you don't have that ass that everybody wants, but if you have enough weight on you to have an ass, your stomach isn't flat enough," she said in the film. "It's all just f--king impossible." As she became aware of the impossible standard of beauty imposed on her and other women, she said it caused her to "go into a real shame-hate spiral."</p><p>At the time, Taylor explained that she's reconciled with "the fact that I'm a size 6 instead of a size double-zero," noting that that sense of peace came with the realization that "if you eat food, have energy, get stronger, you can do all these shows and not feel [enervated]."</p><p>If you or someone you know is struggling with an eating disorder, seek help by calling the National Eating Disorders Association (NEDA) at 1-800-931-2237 or go to NationalEatingDisorders.org.</p><a id=gallery-link-a617e324-676d-444c-9c6d-ba569a066cdf class="media-link gallery-block__link js-track-link js-click-gallery" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:gallery:a617e324-676d-444c-9c6d-ba569a066cdf data-context='{"name":"gallery-block","section":"permalink"}' data-container-ref=toofab:article:197a0588-e20a-4b71-b54c-e46fa54e9483 data-gallery-layout=carousel><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/8a/4by3/2022/10/27/8a1f4377ecfe46d3ac95ce6559ee9dbf_md.jpg width=825 height=618 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3N7kGlma29fqa66uM6rZKyvmZvBbrHDoqusZZaWwW6%2BxJ%2Bcq52emLJuu9StZKieXZa7tbWMoZyrp12iwrS1wmatopyVpHqnu8ulprChnpx6sLrLoqWeZZKWsKy4wKyfaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./prince-harrys-military-uniform-was-altered-but-william-stepped-in-to-show-support.html><span>←</span><span>Prince Harry's 'military uniform' was 'altered' but William stepped in to show 'support'</span></a>
