The iconic “I’ll Make a Man Out of You” singer has transformed his look many times throughout the years, but photos of the former <a href=#>Hollywood heartthrob</a> prove he’s just as handsome as a <a href=#>dad of five</a>.</p><p>Donny got his first taste of superstardom when he joined his older brothers, <a href=#><strong>Alan Osmond</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Wayne Osmond</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Merrill Osmond</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Jay Osmond</strong></a> in their band, <a href=#>The Osmonds</a>. Throughout the late 60s and early 70s, the <a href=#>Masked Singer</a> alum cemented his status as a beloved crooner as they released hit songs including “One Bad Apple,” “Down by the Lazy River” and “Crazy Horses.”</p><p>After collaborating with his brothers for a number of years, Donny teamed up with his sister, <a href=#><strong>Marie Osmond</strong></a>, in the mid-70s. At the time, the&nbsp;superstar siblings were cohosting the Mike Douglas Show, which lead to gigs in their <a href=#>very own variety series, Donny & Marie</a>. The duo’s hour-long program ran for two seasons until their final episode in 1979.</p><p>As he was rising through the ranks in music showbiz, Donny also celebrated many personal accomplishments. In 1978, he tied the knot with his wife, <a href=#><strong>Debbie Osmond</strong></a>, and welcomed their eldest son, Don Jr., that following year in 1979.</p><p>The longtime lovebirds expanded their family with the birth of their second son, Jeremy, in 1981. Throughout the next few years, they also welcomed son Brandon in 1985, Christopher in 1990 and their youngest son, Joshua, in 1998.</p><p>Although Donny took some time to focus on fatherhood, he was still pursuing his career as a musician. In 1989, he released his hit song “Soldier of Love” — which reached No. 2 on the Billboard pop charts — as well as “Sacred Emotion” that same year.</p><p>The Donny & Marie alum&nbsp;proved he was a man of many talents as his career continued to flourish into the 2000s. Aside from appearing on TV shows like Pyramid, America’s Favorite Mom, <a href=#>Dancing With the Stars</a> and more, he also performed as <a href=#>Las Vegas residency</a> alongside Marie from 2008 to 2019.</p><p>Donny has a lot to be proud of when it comes to his run in the entertainment industry. Despite accomplishing tons of awards and accolades over the years, the “Puppy Love” singer is <a href=#>most grateful for his wife</a> and their five kids. He even once credited Debbie for “always [being] the core of [his] life” while he was juggling his earlier years as a star.</p><p>“I am particularly grateful that my dear Debbie has been able to be home with our children and has been such a powerful and uplifting influence on each one of our family,” he told <a href=#>Third Hour</a> in 2014. “Especially in her great support of me in my crazy career that takes me away from the home so much.”</p><p><strong>Scroll through the gallery below to see Donny’s transformation through the years!</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46dpqemqWK8tLnOp5usZaSnrq%2B%2Fxaipppmknryvec%2Bhpq2no2K8p3nToZxmq5mjtKa%2BjK2fnqZdlrulec2ormg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./casey-anthony-blasts-private-investigator-worked-daughter-s-muder-case-claimed-paid-defense-lawyer-sexual-favors-html.html><span>←</span><span>Casey Anthony blasts the private investigator who worked on her daughter's murder case</span></a>
