For 2021's look 19, Chiuri resurrected the shape of the Miss Dior, which was <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="noopener noreferrer">featured</a> in Dior's original perfume advertising campaign. The dress — and the entirety of the new Dior Haute Couture collection — made its debut in a fashion video, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="noopener noreferrer">Le Château du Tarot</a>, directed by Italian filmmaker Matteo Garrone.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">According to a release from Dior, the new interpretation of the Miss Dior dress took a team of six people 800 hours to complete. It includes "gold lamé rouleaux embroidery" with an "appliqué of small, embroidered gold lamé motifs representing flowers blooming on a trellis."</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Courtesy Dior</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Dior also released an exclusive behind-the-scenes look showcasing the "savoir faire" behind the 2021 Miss Dior, including the handwork involved in creating a work of art.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The whole clip blends Chiuri's interpretation of tarot (something that Monsieur Dior was also interested in when they were still called the "divinatory arts") in a way to "manifest proof that couture remains the ultimate territory of experimentation and possibility," according to the heritage brand.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"He discovered tarot in the Second World War, when his sister Catherine, who was part of the French Resistance, disappeared," Chiuri told <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Vogue</a>. "In my view, I think he was so scared about her situation that he probably went to the tarot cards to try to know some more, to hope that she would come back. I think he was very worried; trying to find hope in some signs."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Raf Simons, who also served as creative director at Dior, also reinterpreted the dress in <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="noopener noreferrer">Fall 2012</a> with his look 47.
