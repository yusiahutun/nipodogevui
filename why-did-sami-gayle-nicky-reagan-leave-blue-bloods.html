So much so that viewers didn’t see her again until episode 16. She returned one more time for episode 3 of season 11.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-x6js8g et3p2gv0">This, of course, made fans wonder why the actress stopped being a regular and eventually left the show to begin with.</p><h2 data-node-id=8 class="body-h2 css-1dtpnw8 et3p2gv0">Why did Sami Gayle leave Blue Bloods?</h2><img alt="sami gayle on blue bloods" title="sami gayle on blue bloods" width=3000 height=1996 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/sami-blue-bloods-6467c8d530090.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-1i6sckr e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.countryliving.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p><span class="css-1lk26yx e6iqukd2">John Paul Filo</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-x6js8g et3p2gv0">Part of it has to do with going to school at Columbia while simultaneously attending the university fictitiously in the show.
