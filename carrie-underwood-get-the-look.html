They're usually on sale for less than $20, so consider that a serious steal.</p><p>The singer's embellished beige top has volume, which pairs nicely with the slim bottoms -- it's all about balance with this look. Dorothy Perkins has<a href=#> a similar version</a> for just $27, which will work for your wardrobe across several seasons. You can don it in the fall and the spring, and that makes it an investment item in your closet. Win-win!</p><p>The priciest pieces in the look are accessories, but the good news is both are classic and can be worn with lots of other outfits, meaning the cost-per-wear cancels out the cash you shell out upfront.</p><p>This <a href=#>Legacy Leather Wristlet by Coach</a>, always a popular choice for affordable yet upscale accessories, comes in at $109, but it'll never go out of style. You can also pick whatever color you wish.</p><p>These caged <a href=#>Steve Madden heels</a> are $150, but they are a summer staple and like the wristlet, the cost-per-wear makes them worthwhile. They are about as close to Carrie's pair as you are going to get, too.</p><p>There you have it. That's how you ape Carrie Underwood's street style for under $300.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskajBprvFnKaupqSnxm%2BvzqZmnJmip7amedSnm56qp6S8pXnGnqtmrJiaeq27zqRm</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./vanilla-perfume.html><span>←</span><span>Best vanilla perfumes for 2024</span></a>
