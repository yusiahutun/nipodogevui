The sale sees 25 percent off all products until May 31 with the code <strong>HOTHAIR</strong>, fitting for the "Hot Hair Summer"-dubbed promotion. So, where to start? Nowhere but the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Gro Hair Serum</a>, which <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>over 52,000 people bought</a> over the course of a single month early in the pandemic.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">As the brand's founder, Dan Hodgdon, previously told InStyle, the stress hormone cortisol can lead to excessive hair loss — so the serum reduces inflammation and stimulates microcirculation in the scalp with caffeine, peptides, antioxidant-rich red clover and curcumin, and mung bean for its abundant vitamins and minerals. Per reviewers, the serum slowed their "horrific" hair loss and brought on a large amount of regrowth. <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>A bottle sells every 22 seconds</a>, so it's safe to say people love this stuff.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-square figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Courtesy</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Shop now: </strong>$44 with code <strong>HOTHAIR </strong>(Originally $58); <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">vegamour.com</a></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Gro+ Advanced Hair Serum</a> has raked in similarly glowing comments, perhaps thanks to the addition of nanometer-sized, micro-encapsulated, full-spectrum CBD. Within two months of sticking with the fluid, one fan said they saw new baby hairs coming in; another echoed that within a few weeks, their hairdresser commented on how thick their formerly thinning hair was.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-square figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Courtesy</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Shop now: </strong>$56 with code <strong>HOTHAIR </strong>(Originally $74); <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">vegamour.com</a></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">We love a thickening shampoo, especially because if you're already going to be using a shampoo, it might as well be one infused with thickening, strengthening ingredients. Such is the case with <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Vegamour's Gro Revitalizing Shampoo</a>: It uses the building blocks found in brand's serums, plus vegan keratin to smooth and minimize damage.

One shopper said their lashes "rarely" fall out anymore, and another customer with naturally sparse lashes said it transformed their situation into one that's "full and lush." They continued: "I don't even wear mascara anymore because I don't need to."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_22-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The formula fully grew back spots where they'd pulled out lashes within weeks — results other enthusiasts confirmed.
