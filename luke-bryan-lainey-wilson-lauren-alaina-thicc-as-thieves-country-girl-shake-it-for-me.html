'Girls Is Players Too'?" Bryan says with a sly smile, referencing rapper Coi Leray's hit, "<a href=#>Players</a>."</p><p>Alaina and Wilson recently released their duet "<a href=#>Thicc as Thieves</a>," a track off Alaina's Unlocked EP that samples "Country Girl" as the two artists sing lyrics themed around their generously proportioned, well, assets. Alaina previously told Taste of Country that Bryan&nbsp;— who she's known for many years, and toured with&nbsp;— gave the song an enthusiastic blessing before it came out.</p><p>"I love it. I was very flattered," Bryan added backstage at Nashville's Nissan Stadium on Sunday night (June 11), before he took the stage for his <a href=#>CMA Fest </a>set.</p><p>"When you look at Lainey...I mean, I think Lainey is just so great for country music," the star continues. "And I've been a fan of Lauren Alaina. She has one of the best voices in the world."</p><p>Beyond the fact that he was thrilled to have any musical association with these two talented artists, Bryan says that "Thicc as Thieves" is a clever, catchy update to the kind of hit that "Country Girl" has been for him ever since he first released it in 2011.</p><p>"My biggest thing is, this is a fun song for them. 'Country Girl (Shake It for Me)' was a fun song for me. It was a fun song for the country girls out there that were shaking it. And their song is a fun song for the girls that got a little somethin' to shake," the singer jokes.</p><p>Of course, "Thicc as Thieves" is also a nod to the<a href=#> viral fan response to Wilson's famous booty</a>, and a tongue-in-cheek response to the attention that both she and Alaina get for their rear ends.</p><p>"I think we've all seen the socials light up about Lainey," Bryan says, a twinkle in his eye.</p><p>"I think country music will always be about the real songs, the relatable songs, the songs that stir your heart&nbsp;— but then there's also gotta be a fun aspect of country music, too," Bryan goes on to say. "That's what's so beautiful about when they can go for a song like that, and it can be girls' turns to say that stuff. It's awesome. I'm very flattered to be a part of it."</p><h2 class=photogallery-title>Pictures: See Inside Luke Bryan's Stunning Beach House</h2><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Luke Bryan</a> listed his 4,600-square-foot beach house for sale in December 2022.
