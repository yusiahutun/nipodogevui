It’s just suddenly surfaced that he’s been dating her for several years.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=29 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Are Reeves and Grant a good match?

They’re artists. They’re just going to do what they do.”</p><h2 data-node-id=34 class="body-h3 css-11vz3s8 emevuu60">Grant said Reeves is an “inspiration” for her art.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=35 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In a September 2023 interview with <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://people.com/keanu-reeves-girlfriend-alexandra-grant-opens-up-about-their-relationship-7973905 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=People class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">People</a>, the artist spoke openly about her relationship with Reeves.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=36 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“What I love about Keanu and our exchange is that we’re pushing each other to build new roads,” she told the outlet. “Seeing the other person’s problem-solving is inspiring, like, ‘Oh, well, okay, this one, that’s a cul-de-sac. How do I try this other thing?’” She added, “He’s such an inspiration to me. He’s so creative, he’s so kind. He works so hard.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=37 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Grant drew parallels between both of their crafts.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=38 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“My work is much more of a private performance, but I have a text that I interpret in the studio into a painting, into an object,” she explained. “He takes the text in private and then turns it into a performance in public. There’s a relationship. We’re both at the heart readers and researchers. We both care about people and we care about characters.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=39 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Reeves has helped her make art that’s “happier,” Grant said: “I had a studio visit a few years ago, and this very kind, very high-level person said, ‘I can see that your work has gotten happier.’ That’s real. We’re all human beings. We’re animals. We’re expressing from where we are and certainly feeling happier. I think the work is happier.”</p><img alt="2019 LACMA Art + Film Gala Honoring Betye Saar And Alfonso Cuarón Presented By Gucci - Inside" title="2019 LACMA Art + Film Gala Honoring Betye Saar And Alfonso Cuarón Presented By Gucci - Inside" width=3086 height=2127 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-1185175934.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Emma McIntyre</span><span class="css-5ck6gj e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span><p>Alexandra Grant and Keanu Reeves attend the 2019 LACMA Art + Film Gala.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=41 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">She also talked about the benefits of forming a long-lasting relationship as a mature adult. “The good news about falling in love as an adult is that I had built my own career by the time that my relationship had begun. I feel very confident in the relationship on the red carpet. I feel confident on it alone,” she said. “It’s interdependent and independent in the best ways.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=42 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">As for Reeves’s recent reunion with his alternative rock band, Dogstar, Grant said, “I’m really proud. I am a huge Dogstar fan. I had the great pleasure of going to their first public show and because I’ve been listening to the latest album for quite some time, I was one of the only people in the audience who knew all the lyrics.
