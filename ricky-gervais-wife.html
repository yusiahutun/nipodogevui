After appearing on several podcasts, Gervais starred in the UK version of The Office. After this, he created and starred in several TV shows like Extras, The Ricky Gervais Show, Life’s Too Short, and Idiot Abroad. He also hosted several <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Golden Globe Awards</a>. In 2018, his show After Life was picked up by Netflix and subsequently signed him a multi-year deal with Netflix, which will see the comedian develop new scripted projects for the streaming platform, as well as stand-up specials.</p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/cara-d-featured.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/86401_12638518771.jpg><p>Before his latest Netflix stand-up comedy special Armaggedon was released, Gervais received criticism for using the R-slur during a teaser of his set. A Change.org petition with over 13,000 signatures calling to remove the joke.</p><p>“I can play to a million people, I won’t get a complaint,” Gervais said on BBC 5’s Headliner’s Podcast. “As soon as it goes on Netflix or as soon as someone writes up a joke that says this is offensive, people go, ‘Oh, that’s offensive.’ They haven’t even heard the joke. They weren’t there. Ignore them. They don’t count. They have no effect on me. They don’t count. They’re hecklers.”</p><p>So back to whether Ricky Gervais <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">has a wife</a> and if he’s married his long-term girlfriend. Here’s what we know.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=does-ricky-gervais-have-a-wife>Does Ricky Gervais Have A Wife?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/ricky-gervais-wife-1.jpg><p>Does Ricky Gervais have a wife? No, but he’s been together with his girlfriend Jane Fallon since 1982.</p><p>The two met while they were attending University College London in the 1980s and moved in together in 1984. Fallon went on to become a producer, only to become a full-time novelist in 2008.</p><p>Fallon recalled the conditions of which they moved in together for the first time. They “went through a good few years when we had absolutely no money, and I’ve talked about this before — the brothel we lived above in Kings Cross — I always knew I had a plan to build up a career and I think once you do that it does mean a lot more because you’ve worked for all of it.”</p><p>As to why they don’t want to marry, Gervais told The Times in 2010: “We are <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/ricky-gervais-bad-parents-should-be-sterilised-fact-p37vpwx07rp rel=nofollow>married for all intents</a> and purposes, everything’s shared and actually our fake marriage has lasted longer than a real one. But there’s no point in us having an actual ceremony before the eyes of God because there is no God.”</p><p>Fallon also shared the same sentiments, “We’re not married because neither of [us] are fussed. I think if one of us really cared then we would probably do it but it’s not really been anything that either of us have ever really needed.” The two don’t have any children either.</p><p>Gervais reveals that he runs by each joke to her on the Golden Globes red carpet. “A couple of times I’ve said, ‘Nope, please don’t,’” Fallon told Ryan Seacrest.</p><p>“That’s what she says — she says, ‘Please don’t,’” the comedian confirmed. “She uses emotional blackmail.”</p><p>Gervais also revealed that Fallon partially inspired After Life. “I don’t think I’ve ever been lonely,” he told <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/ricky-gervais-heartbreaking-inspiration-behind-25886980 rel=nofollow>The Mirror.</a> “I don’t think I’ve ever suffered from depression or despair like Tony. I’ve seen it – you don’t get to 60 without seeing most things. I’ve lost both parents and a sibling, and all my pets and some friends.</p><p>“But the ultimate for me would be losing my soulmate. That’s the worst thing that could happen to me. So, it’s an imagination, a fiction, that stems from that.”</p><p>Our mission at STYLECASTER is to bring style to the people, and we only feature products we think you’ll love as much as we do.
