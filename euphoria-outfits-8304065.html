Euphoria, HBO’s over-the-top teenage drama created by Sam Levinson, chronicles the lives of several California high schoolers dealing with everything from drugs and dating to mental illness and toxic masculinity. While the subject matter is often heavy, the unique Euphoria outfits are just as much a topic of conversation —&nbsp;and have earned their place on our digital mood boards.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">For this, we have the show’s costume director, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Heidi Bivens</a>, to thank. Known for her work on aesthetically driven films like Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind and Spring Breakers, Bivens has a knack for creating characters and telling their stories through fashion. Following the show’s second season, Bivens released a book, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>Euphoria Fashion</a>, with A24. The book offers a deep dive into her approach to costume design, particularly the methods used to build distinctive wardrobes for each member of the Euphoria cast, plus conversations with on-set collaborators including <a href=# class=pseudoStyle data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>Zendaya</a>, Hunter Shafer, and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=4>makeup artist Donni Davy</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">If you'd like to dress like your favorite Euphoria character —&nbsp;or just want to know more about the process behind their signature styles, you're in the right place. Ahead, we examine eight characters and what their wardrobes say about them.<br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-alexa-demie-as-maddy-perez></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Alexa Demie as Maddy Perez</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Max</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">There’s something about Maddy. Perhaps the least realistically dressed of the Euphoria crew, Maddy pushes the boundaries with what is acceptable — or even believable — for a teenager to wear in the classroom. The sharp-tongued siren has worn designer brands like Jacquemus, I.AM.GIA, and Amina Muaddi, which Bivens acknowledges are out of the typical teenager’s reach.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“I allowed myself to do that because by then, it had become clear to audiences that Euphoria was not set up to be visually realistic, as some teen shows are,” she explained to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Harper’s Bazaar</a>. Maddy's fierce ‘fits and signature cat-eye undoubtedly helped to put Euphoria’s costume and makeup departments on everyone’s radar.&nbsp;To channel her look, you'll want something bodycon — ideally with cutouts —&nbsp;though a hoodie is also a main component, if you want a practical layer.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-sydney-sweeney-as-cassie-howard></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Sydney Sweeney as Cassie Howard</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Max</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">It’s hard to keep up with Cassie, whose costumes toe the line between girl-next-door sweet and too-sexy-for-school. She’s still figuring out who she is, and that comes across in her ever-changing style.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_17-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“[She's] the kind of girl that would like to try on lots of different trends, whether it's because her friends were doing it or because she thought it was sexy or because someone told her it was a cool brand or whatever,” Bivens shared with <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Entertainment Weekly</a>. “[Cassie] I think represents a lot of what we'll see on Instagram, which is teens trying on lots of different personas in trying to find themselves.” That might just be the most relatable thing said about any Euphoria character.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-maude-apatow-as-lexi-howard></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_21-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Maude Apatow as Lexi Howard</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_22-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Max</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_23-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The character of Lexi’s style is distinctly different from that of her older sister, Cassie, and it evolves quite a bit from season 1 to season 2. Most of Lexi’s outfits have a vintage, preppy vibe, which speaks to her more bookish qualities. As a result, her appearance is much more conservative — or, dare we say, realistic — than her classmates. Intriguingly, it’s Lexi whose wardrobe is most familiar to Bivens. “[In the] second season, there’s a lot of Lexi pieces that I think would’ve been in my closet over the years,” she told <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Bustle</a>, noting that the character’s style was heavily inspired by a close friend.&nbsp;</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-hunter-schafer-as-jules-vaughn></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_25-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Hunter Schafer as Jules Vaughn</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_26-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Max</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_27-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Bivens has the tendency to gush over Jules Vaughn’s outfits, and it’s not hard to see why. “Jules is my fave, because she wasn’t really modeled after any person who existed before her character,” the costume designer shared with <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Bustle</a>. Speaking to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>CNN</a>, Bivens also described the way Jules begins to dress for the male gaze as “her own avatar of a cisgender teenage girl."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_29-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Notably, Hunter Schafer is very involved in creating the character’s wardrobe, even going so far as to DIY the necklace worn for her memorable New Year's Eve Look. “She had this star trim, and I gave her a dark green sheer ribbon, and she sewed it on set and put it on the day that we finalized that look,” Bivens recalled in a conversation with <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Interview</a> magazine. “She loves being involved in that way, and it makes everything better because she’s so creative.”</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-barbie-ferreira-as-kat-hernandez></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_31-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Barbie Ferreira as Kat Hernandez</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_32-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Max</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_33-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Bivens told InStyle in 2019</a> that initially, Kat’s wardrobe was inspired by Thora Birch's character from the 2001 film Ghost World. As she becomes more comfortable in her body, Kat's style shifts from a quirky, bespectacled vibe to full-on BDSM attire, both at school and behind closed doors. She genuinely has a trend-forward sense of style; Kat’s custom Mimi Wade New Years Eve outfit stands out as a particular favorite. And although Ferreira won’t be returning for season 3, her character’s parting words won’t soon be forgotten: "There's nothing more powerful than a fat girl who doesn't give a f—k."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-zendaya-as-rue-bennett></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_37-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Zendaya as Rue Bennett</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_38-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Max</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_39-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Rue’s penchant for sweatshirts and other oversized attire speaks volumes about her state of mind as a young addict. Her basic T-shirts, Hanes tank tops, and bike shorts are meant to be ultra-casual — and are intentionally gender-neutral as Rue begins to figure out her identity.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_41-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"While designing the show, I’ve really tried to be aware of what is heteronormative and not fall into stereotypes of what is considered traditionally masculine and feminine," Bivens told InStyle. "Rue is a character who likes to be comfortable and while she has a distinct personal style, it comes naturally to her. She has been consistent with her style since she was old enough to dress herself; she is clear in her mind about what she likes."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-storm-reid-as-gia-bennett></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_45-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Storm Reid as Gia Bennett</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_46-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Max</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_47-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Like everyone in Euphoria, Gia Bennett has a lot of growing up to do. The younger sister of a troubled Rue, Gia is a freshman when the series begins and primarily wears T-shirts, sneakers, and jeans. Sporty but casual, Gia’s outfits are similar to her sister’s, but a bit more juvenile in color and fit. Given that last season’s argument between Gia and Rue — improvised by Storm Reid and Zendaya — was perhaps the most illuminating moment for her character thus far, we hope to see a lot more of Gia and her style evolution in season 3.<br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-chloe-cherry-as-faye></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_49-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Chloe Cherry as Faye</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_50-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Max</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_51-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Classmates and fans of the show alike are still getting to know Faye, who joined the crew in season 2. “Faye is all things Y2K,” Bivens told <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Mensbook</a>. “Fashion is cyclical, and the attention Faye's style received when season 2 aired was a reminder that the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>early 2000s</a> were overdue for a renaissance."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_53-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">According to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Vogue</a>, several of Faye’s looks came directly from Cherry’s closet, so fans can expect even more authentic new-millennium-era fashion with plenty of miniskirts, baby tees, and her signature pouty lips.<br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57xK6noaeinq5uu9StnaKso2KFdHyTaW1u</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./how-to-clean-brass.html><span>←</span><span>How to Clean Brass - 5+ Ways to Clean Tarnished Brass with Vinegar and Toothpaste</span></a>
