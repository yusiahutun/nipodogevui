The 28-year-old supermodel, who has a child with former One Direction singer Zayn Malik and has been linked to actor Leonardo DiCaprio, has a jaw angle of 141.9 degrees viewed from the front of her face.
That is close to the 'perfect' angle of 142 degrees, according to researchers.
When the model's face was shown to 32 expert facial surgeons and 16 ordinary people, they unanimously agreed her jawline was neither too steep nor too flat."><meta name=author content="Jenniffer Sheldon"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

class=mol-para-with-font>The jaw angle is measured where the vertical part of the jaw, coming straight down from the ear, changes angle to become a more gentle slope towards the chin.</p><p

said:&nbsp;'It is amazing that relatively small differences in the angle of women's jaws can really have a large impact on people's views of their attractiveness.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'The pandemic has shifted face-to-face meetings onto video calls, making people more conscious of their facial appearance, so it is interesting, not just for scientists, to know which angles and contours of the face are seen to be beautiful.'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Researchers conducted an online survey, in which they asked people to rate different aspects of the jawlines of 53 female celebrities and models.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Actress Amber Heard was rated as having a jaw angle which was not too steep and not too flat by 95 per cent of raters.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Screen siren Brigitte Bardot and the Russian model Irina Shayk, former partner of actor Bradley Cooper, were found to have an attractive slope of their lower jaw, by at least 80 per cent of the raters.</p><img id=i-f0f232778bbabfa3 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2023/09/15/16/75479717-12522159-image-m-69_1694792655911.jpg height=723 width=634 alt

across the middle of the face, is 0.83.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>It follows a similar study in 2016 which found men are preferred to have a strong jaw.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>For
