It just feels right," she added.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Rexha said Safyari has been the perfect companion during the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>coronavirus</a> pandemic.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I wasn't lonely during quarantine," she said. "I have a very wonderful man in my life right now and he's so amazing. I'm very grateful for him and I'm just enjoying my life and seeing where it goes."</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Bebe Rexha.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner>The Image Direct</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Last month the Albanian-American star was <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>spotted kissing her filmmaker beau</a> in Los Angeles after gifting him a Ferrari for his boyfriend. The two were first spotted together in <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>March</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">This is Rexha's first public romance in years. She also talked to ET about why she's mostly kept Safyari private on social media.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Unless I have a ring on my finger, you ain't getting a grid post, and that's the truth!" she joked.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-21 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I have a love-hate relationship with social media," Rexha said. "I love it because I can talk to my fans and see what's up with them, but then you see things you don't wanna see."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>RELATED VIDEO: Bebe Rexha Teases New Music Is Coming ‘Very Soon’: ‘I’ve Been Focusing on the Art’</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-27 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Mean comments, or when you go into a rabbit hole, becoming like Inspector Gadget and seeing things you don't wanna see, especially when you're in a relationship," she added.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-29 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Rexha explained that during a previous relationship, she did "the crazy girlfriend deep dive" and saw things she didn't like.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-31 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"It's tough in relationships to be on social media ... other females, you get them in your head and you get a little insecure," she said. "I just saw likes and messages and comments, and I was like, 'Ugh, why? What don't I have that she has?' Like, this guy that I'm dating, why is he flirting with her?"</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-33 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">And her comments about social media fit in with the message behind her new song alongside <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Doja Cat</a>, "Baby I'm Jealous."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-39 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I love songs that make you feel good but actually say something. I was like, 'I can't be the only one that feels this way,'" she shared. "And I think what makes this song empowering is the fact that I was able to be like, 'Yeah, I get jealous.' We all get jealous sometimes, and I don't love being jealous, but this is part of human nature."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-41 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The star also shared some kind words for the "Say So" rapper.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-43 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"She really wanted to make the video great, really wanted to make the song great," she told the outlet. "She's just excited and wants to create and she's just like a pleasant person to be around. It just felt right [to have her] and I was so happy with what she did with the song. It's amazing!"</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-45 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In the video — featuring makeup guru <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Nikita Dragun</a> and TikTok stars <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Charli D'Amelio</a> and Avani — the group of friends have Chinese food and discuss Rexha's jealousy.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-51 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">She asks her phone to send a text to her boyfriend asking, "Why are you being so shady?" before adding, "Sometimes I'm so over social media, like can we go back in time to the 1800s? I bet the girls back then didn't have to deal with any of this."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-53 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The video follows Doja Cat and Rexha as they time travel thanks to a magic fortune cookie (à la 13 Going on 30). The clip also makes reference to Doja Cat's drama earlier this year when <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>she was "canceled"</a> for participating in seemingly racist chat groups in her past.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-55 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Girlfriend, you'd be sharing your bed faster than you could get canceled on Twitter," says Dragun, after Rexha suggests that growing up in the 1960s would be "a lot easier."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-57 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"S---, she has a point," Doja Cat responds after opening her eyes wide.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-59 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Baby I'm Jealous" is out now.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiolaS9rbGNnKamZ52qwKqvjpucm51dp7K5tMBmq5qkm6h6r7HWZpmosZantqa6w2ainrGRo3q0rcWymKuhXw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./what-is-keystone-correction.html><span>←</span><span>What Is Keystone Correction in Projectors?</span></a>
