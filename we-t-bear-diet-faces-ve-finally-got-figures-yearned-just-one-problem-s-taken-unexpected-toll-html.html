Dr Jonquille Chantrey, a Cheshire-based cosmetic surgeon, says this can make the skin look like it’s melting. ‘The ligaments in the face support the soft tissue.

As a result, restricting calories can cause the face to become malnourished, explains Dr Aamer Khan, of the Harley Street Skin Clinic.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>‘As a survival method, the body starts to divert nutrition to the essential organs, so the non-essential parts of the body - the skin and soft tissues of the face, neck, decolletage and hands - suffer,’ he says.</span></p><img id=i-8c9c455b284eca2d src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2016/06/08/22/3501683300000578-3632126-image-a-144_1465422374774.jpg height=1049 width=634 alt="She said that when she was 'fat' she had a 'round face and podgy, young-looking cheeks'.

This declines at a rate of 1 per cent to 1.7 per cent a year from that point onwards, and drops dramatically around the time of the menopause, due to the decline in the amount of oestrogen our bodies are producing.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>Without collagen, the skin loses its ability to ‘bounce back’ into shape, so as the fat in the face melts away, it’s left slack and droopy rather than stretched tight.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>We’re also more prone to losing fat in the face as we get older, and less able to replace it. This is because younger women have a thicker dermis - the inner layer of skin containing the blood vessels and hair follicles - which acts as an extra shield for our looks.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>‘This makes the face more resilient to the underlying volume changes of the fat pockets,’ says Dr Papageorgiou. ‘For example, the skin of a young patient undergoing neck liposuction will be thick and elastic and able to adapt to the new contour, while older patients can have significant sagging once the fat has been removed.’</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>Even if they do regain weight, this is unlikely to go back into the face. Because we don’t need fat in this part of the body, it will naturally settle elsewhere. As well as being the first place we lose fat, the face is the last place it tends to go back on.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>An ageing face seems a high price to pay for a supple young body, especially considering all the work that goes into dieting in middle-age.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>But even higher are the costs required to rectify ‘diet face’.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>Experts recommend facial fillers, made from hyaluronic acid - a compound found naturally in the body - that can plump out the deflated fat pockets in the face. These cost around £150 a go, with most people needing a course of five.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>What’s more, the effects last only up to 18 months and so the treatment has to be repeated or diet face will return.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>‘Fillers can be used in very small doses, injected directly into the affected fat pads to recreate the lifted, smooth look,’ explains Dr Chantrey, who has performed the procedure on thousands of patients in the past eight years.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>‘Temples, upper cheeks and under the lower eyelid tend to be the first key areas.’</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>For damage to the eyelids, chin and neck, the best option is a face lift, which pulls excess flesh upwards and inwards via an incision at the hairline. This is pricier still, costing upwards of £7,000.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>With all this to contend with, it’s worth bearing Catherine Deneuve’s old adage in mind. And perhaps, when you reach that certain age, you might choose to put your body second and your face first.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pa3IpbCmmZmhe6S7ja6iaJ6Voq6quI6aqa2hk6Gybn%2BVbGlqamZkpKZ502aZnpmiYrGqsdNmnZqblah6t7GMn6CnmZyhxm6zzq1kn6GXqr%2Bmv4yynJqqnpqxbpbUrKtmp56aerG%2BzpujnqVdqHq1rcqepWatnprFsbHCrZydZaSkua16x62kpQ%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./352699-cash-advance-apps-dave-html.html><span>←</span><span>15 best cash advance apps like Dave for instant loans in 2021</span></a>
