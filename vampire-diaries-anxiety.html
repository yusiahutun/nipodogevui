Meditate! Exercise! Journal! I’m sure plenty of other people find these strategies helpful—and more power to ‘em. But me? <a href=#>When I’m depressed, I binge-watch <i><a href=# id=auto-tag_the-vampire-diaries data-tag=the-vampire-diaries>The Vampire Diaries</a></i></a>, a show about unreasonably hot vampires made for teenagers. I’ve watched the entire series more times than I can count, and before you ask, I am not embarrassed about this at all. The thing is, sometimes when I’m really going through it, going for a run or breathing in counts of four is not enough to get myself back to a manageable headspace. Yes, regular exercise and meditation are healthy habits I encourage everyone to try. But consuming media (even media as silly as <i>The Vampire Diaries</i>!) is a legitimate coping tool as well.</span></p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/nina_dobrev.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/kat_graham1.jpg><p class=p1><span class=s1>It should be noted here, first and foremost, that if you live with an anxiety disorder or depression and seeing a regular therapist is within your power—do that. What I’m talking about here is dealing with an anxiety attack outside the therapist’s office and finding the right coping tools that work for you.</span><span class=s1>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>I have Generalized Anxiety Disorder with a side of depression and ADHD that was only diagnosed a few months ago. These things sometimes make life difficult for me, especially in the years when getting therapy was not a possibility. A lot of Googling on how to deal with anxiety tended to lead me to many of the same responses, namely: meditation, exercise like running, deep breathing, or the very vaguely described “mindfulness.”</span><span class=s1>&nbsp;</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/the-vampire-diaries-2.jpg><p class=p1><span class=s1>The thing is, when left alone with my brain for any amount of time, it begins to attack me, like a running ticker tape of everything I’ve messed up, will mess up, forgot to do that day or how I’m otherwise screwed. I usually rise from meditation sessions in panicked tears, way worse than when I started, having just been bombarded with every negative emotion I’d been trying to keep at bay. Running also gives me way too much time to think, while focusing on my breath tends to cause me to forget how to breathe.</span><span class=s1>&nbsp;</span></p><figure class=wp-block-pullquote readability=1.5><p>When left alone with my brain for any amount of time, it begins to attack me.</p></figure><p class=p1><span class=s1>I was feeling pretty out of options and ugly-crying at an intake session with a therapist when she told me it was actually pretty common for people with anxiety to respond badly to meditation. In fact, it could even be damaging.

What I mean is, when I have “your life is actually falling apart” playing on a loop in my head and I can’t shake myself out of it, what I need is to focus on something else for a little while. For me, watching Stefan and Damon Salvatore fight for Elena’s heart in the downtime between outwitting some all-powerful foe is just the ticket.</span></p><figure class=wp-block-pullquote readability=1.5><p>When I’m panicking, what I don’t need is more time to focus on it.</p></figure><p class=p1><span class=s1><i>The Vampire Diaries</i> is not high-brow television by anyone’s estimation. The thing it has going for it is satisfying melodrama, occasional comedy and breakneck plotting that refuses to go stale (at least until season 5). It’s fun, compulsively watchable TV, and it never fails to distract me from whatever I’d been panicked about before. When I’m panicking, what I don’t need is more time to focus on it.</span><span class=s1>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s2><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Christen Sistrunk, MA, LPC,</a></span><span class=s1> a therapist focused on anxiety disorders and depression in Houston, Texas, says this is totally legit.</span><span class=s1>&nbsp;</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/the-vampire-diaries.jpg><p class=p1><span class=s1>“When we’re feeling really bad, we might watch something or do something like self-care that’s going to make us feel a different emotion,” she says. Sistrunk explains how, for some people, watching TV “engenders a different type of cognitive process,” which allows them to reset and approach problems with a fresh mindset afterward. She relates it to a form of cognitive behavioral therapy called<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow"> <span class=s2>Dialectical behavioral therapy (DBT),</span></a> which teaches emotional regulation, among other skills. One exercise that teaches this skill is to identify an emotion, and then do something to make you feel the opposite of that emotion. Feeling lonely? Make plans with friends.</span></p><figure class=wp-block-pullquote readability=1.5><p>Sometimes your brain just needs a break, and there is nothing wrong with taking it.&nbsp;</p></figure><p class=p1><span class=s1>But, Sistrunk warns, beware of letting this self-care slide into obsessive or addictive behaviors. Think of it like a tub of ice cream. You could eat a cup, you could eat a pint or you could eat a whole gallon. The secret is in finding the balance.</span><span class=s1>&nbsp;</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/the-vampire-diaries-3.jpg><p class=p1><span class=s1>There was a point in my life I was a little embarrassed about my love of <a href=#><i>The Vampire Diaries</i></a>, but I’m here to remove the Teen Soap Opera stigma—and all the other judgement around low-brow entertainment.
