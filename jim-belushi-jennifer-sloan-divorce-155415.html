According to new reports, <a href=#>Jim Belushi</a>‘s wife, Jennifer Sloan, filed for divorce from the actor on Monday, March 5 after 20 years of marriage.

He was first married to Sandra Davenport from 1980 until 1988. They share a 37-year-old son, Robert Belushi. He was also hitched to Marjorie Bransfield from 1990 until 1992, but they never had any children together.</p><p>In a previous interview, Jen shared that she and Jim didn’t hit it off immediately. “He kissed me on the forehead like I was his sister,” she told <a href=#>People</a> in 2003. “A couple weeks later he asked me to go rollerblading, and I liked him that day. He was real.” Back at that time 15 years ago, Jim also gushed about life with his wife. “We can’t wait to get to each other at the end of the day,” he shared with the news outlet.</p><p>The According to Jim star previously opened up about how his third marriage “softened me a lot.” He said in 2003, “It used to freak me out when people asked, ‘Where do you see yourself in five years?’ I had no vision. I was always about the work.” Jennifer replied at the time, “He’s settled into being more of a family guy. And he loves going to work every day.”</p><p>The couple hasn’t been seen in public together since November 2017. We wish them the best during their difficult breakup.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46joKZlkpq5tr%2FHomSjnZ6jtqex0WaqpaeRo3qltdWoqZydXWaCdoCQbmY%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./artificial-intelligence-specialists-builders-midwives-among-hong-kongs-expanded-talent-list-offering.html><span>←</span><span>Artificial intelligence specialists, builders, midwives among Hong Kongs expanded talent list off</span></a>
