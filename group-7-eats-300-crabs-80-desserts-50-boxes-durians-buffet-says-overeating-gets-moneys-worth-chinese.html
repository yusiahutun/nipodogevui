But it made people sick that you showed off the crab shells and other waste. You are proud because you’ve gained at a cost to others. You don’t have a moral bottom line.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The Chinese government passed a law to prevent food waste two years ago to curb excessive food consumption as the country’s food supply remains in a “tight balance” due to supply chain issues and high demand.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">It is common in China for customers at buffet restaurants to eat as much as they can in the hope the value of the food they eat will equal or exceed the price of admission.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">This results in many customers taking more food than they can eat, which is then thrown out, prompting restaurants to display posters reminding people to practise moderation when eating and drinking.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Last month, two women in eastern China’s Zhejiang province were detained by authorities for secretly taking food worth 400 yuan from a buffet restaurant after they had eaten inside.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51ku6bD0minnqegobJur9Slq66qlWTBs7HNnaCnn12Ytaq6wGiYq6yZmLmme5JraHJvZ2l8qL7Orqdmb12arrW%2FjGxnaWWTp66jv4xxZ2aclajApr7TrGRuaF2XvLmx0mabrqqZlru0ecGunZ%2BdpGLAosXSZqavnaKarrW1zaBkoJ2kqHquu82esKxlp6S%2FtbSMnJ%2BippWosg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./tracee-ellis-ross-house-tour-the-black-ish-stars-home.html><span>←</span><span>Tracee Ellis Ross Los Angeles Home Is Full of Colorful Decor!
