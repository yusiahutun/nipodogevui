In this mysterious, fairy-tale-like setting, benches are placed next to the felled tree. The exhibition text explains that we are looking at a scene inspired by a traditional gay cruising spot in London and the <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Lam Tsuen Wishing Tree</span></a> in the New Territories in Hong Kong.<h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Hong Kong artist creates his work with plants, not paints</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">There are shrivelled clumps of orange and yellow tissue scattered on the floor, reminiscent of a variety of activities, from post-hookup clean-ups to the oranges that believers toss up to the wishing tree. A woody, musky scent is in the air. There is a diffuser on one side of the room, also surrounded by clumps of tissue. We are told that what we smell may also come from behind two closed cupboard doors: a pile of sweat-soaked, pheromone-rich T-shirts.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">I had gone there to escape the throngs that descended on Para Site’s main floor for an Art Basel event on March 28. For a short while, there was just me and another person sitting on the other side of the log. In the hushed atmosphere, I could have been in that clearing in Hampstead Heath, checking out a stranger.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The log is not real. Yeung made a replica, using scented soap, of a section of the famous “F*** Tree” in Hampstead Heath – an ancient oak that might have developed its curved contour owing to the number of bodies that have been pressed against it since the 19th century.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/04/15/2e14f596-188f-4864-a900-9133636e7290_1094bf21.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">He made his first “F*** Tree” in London in 2023 for “Soft Ground”, an earlier iteration of the exhibition at Gasworks, which co-commissioned the tree with Para Site and Aranya Art Centre in mainland China.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">It is in this Hong Kong show that the discarded orange tissues have appeared to make the link with the wishing tree. What can these two trees possibly have in common?</p>Well, just as the London oak tree has been bent out of shape and its bark worn down through heavy use, the last of the “real” Chinese banyan wishing trees was severely damaged in 2005 by the weight of too many oranges and “treasure plates” bearing prayer messages. These days, prayers are directed at <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">an artificial replica made in Guangzhou</span></a>.<h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Why Hong Kong remains Asia’s leading arts hub despite tough Covid curbs</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">With both trees, we loved them, we turned them into vessels of our own desires, and then we abused them – which just about sums up humanity’s relationship with nature.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">But Yeung’s practice is never just about being respectful of nature. His strategy of queering normative distinctions can be seen in how he highlights the blurred line between natural and artificial: after all, the many who still queue in Lam Tsuen at Lunar New Year believe that the tree god has successfully attached itself to a new plastic home.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">By melding the trees together, he raises the question of moral hierarchy. A Google search suggests both traditions started in the 1800s. One represents a self-abandonment to divine providence, the other, the self-abandonment to the pleasuring of and being pleasured by a stranger.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/04/15/49df1bcb-0899-4a2b-bc10-6882ae85aa72_2a48f19f.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Yeung’s choice of soap as the material for the “F*** Tree” replica suggests that cruising can be cleansing. (Coincidentally, Louise Giovanelli’s exhibition that is now on at White Cube Hong Kong also explores that liminal space between sexual and spiritual ecstasy.)</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Will the most important exhibition of his career – representing Hong Kong during the world’s most important contemporary art event in Venice – measure up to the convincing immersive experience of “Soft Breath”? Stay tuned.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Trevor Yeung: Soft Breath”, Para Site annex, 10B, Wing Wah Industrial Building, 677 King’s Road, Quarry Bay, Wed-Sun, 12-7pm.
