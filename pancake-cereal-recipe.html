But what if we told you there‚Äôs a fresh twist that‚Äôs both adorable and delicious? Say hello to pancake cereal, the perfect transformation of a classic stack of pancakes into bite-sized delights. Crispy on the outside, fluffy on the inside and tossed with butter and maple syrup ‚Äî it‚Äôs enough to make anyone‚Äôs mouth water. This is one breakfast trend that‚Äôs sure to brighten your morning and so fun to eat. And the best part? It‚Äôs easy to make with this 20 minute recipe. We‚Äôre sharing some expert secrets to making a perfect batch. Plus, learn about customizing your pancake cereal with new flavors and fun topping ideas. Here‚Äôs everything you need to make pancake cereal.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What is pancake cereal?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/03/pancake-cereal.jpg><p>From pancake spaghetti to souffl√© pancakes, you can turn this comfort breakfast meal into just about any new dish. So when we heard about the viral pancake cereal recipe, we had to see what the hype was about. This recipe uses your standard pancake batter but instead of spooning it onto a skillet with a ladle, you start them in a condiment bottle. Using one allows for perfectly squeezed cereal-sized pancakes, which then get poured into a bowl with toppings. OK, so it may not be real cereal without milk (though you can add it), but no one wants soggy pancakes. Check out this TikTok video to learn more about the craze.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok"><a title=@sunnysrecipes href=#>@sunnysrecipes</a><p>Mini things just taste better.

Recreating those photo-worthy miniature pancakes just takes a little attention to detail and some guidance. These expert tips from <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">i am a food blog</a> will have you making pancake cereal perfectly in no time.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>1. Batter consistency</h3><p>Aim for a thick but pourable batter consistency. Too thin, and your pancakes will spread out in the pan and lose their miniature form. But too thick, and they won‚Äôt cook evenly (or come out easily from the bottle). Check out this easy video recipe for the best fluffy pancake batter:</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"></figure><p><strong>Related: </strong><a href=#>Whipping Up This Breakfast Classic From Scratch Is Safer Than a Boxed Mix ‚Äî Here‚Äôs Why</a></p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>2. Piping technique</h3><p>Use a squeeze bottle to dispense the batter. This allows for more control over the size and shape of the pancakes so they all come out the same. Additionally, pipe them smaller than you think as they will spread out in the pan.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>3. Cooking temperature</h3><p>To prevent burning your pancakes, start your heat on low, then turn it up once you‚Äôve finished piping. This allows them to cook evenly.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>4. Flipping pancake cereal</h3><p>Leave enough space in between your pancakes to allow for easy flipping. You can use a spatula, knife or even chopsticks to flip them once bubbles form on the surface and the edges begin to set. You can even just shake the pan!</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Customize your pancake cereal</h2><p>Like regular pancakes, pancake cereal can be entirely customized to suit your dietary preferences, restrictions or wishes. With a few simple swaps and substitutions, you can customize your pancake cereal the way you want while still enjoying all the deliciousness of this fun breakfast. Here are some suggestions:</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Flavors</h3><p>You can‚Äôt go wrong with plain pancakes, but why stop there when you can get try new flavors? Make it indulgent with some cocoa powder, or sprinkle in spices like cinnamon and nutmeg. Or you can add a touch of brightness with freshly grated lemon zest. But if you want something a little more adventurous, try matcha powder, as shown in the TikTok video below:</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok"><a title=@botanikherbsandtea href=#>@botanikherbsandtea</a><p>flipped each one by hand ü•≤ <a title=botanikherbsandtea href=#>#botanikherbsandtea</a> <a title=matcha href=#>#matcha</a> <a title=matchatea href=#>#matchatea</a> <a title=pancakecereal href=#>#pancakecereal</a> <a title=pancakes href=#>#pancakes</a> <a title=matchapancakes href=#>#matchapancakes</a> <a title=matchapancakecereal href=#>#matchapancakecereal</a></p><a title="‚ô¨ original sound - tomlinsonchrry ‚òÄÔ∏è" href=#>‚ô¨ original sound ‚Äì tomlinsonchrry ‚òÄÔ∏è</a></figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Healthier substitutions</h3><p>For a healthier option, consider using whole wheat flour or almond flour in place of all-purpose flour. Or swap out traditional sugar for a natural sweetener like <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">honey</a> or maple syrup. Additionally, you can use mashed bananas as the star ingredient. They add natural sweetness and provide a boost of vitamins, minerals and fiber. And if you want to increase your daily protein intake, try using <a href=#>protein powder</a> or high-protein pancake mix. This not only adds a nutritional boost but also helps keep you feeling full longer.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Gluten-free + dairy-free</h3><p>If you follow a gluten-free diet, you can use alternatives such as almond, <a href=#>coconut</a> or a gluten-free flour blend to make your pancakes. And for those with dairy allergies or intolerances, you can easily substitute dairy-free milk like almond, coconut or <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">oat</a>, and vegan butter in place of traditional ingredients.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Simple pancake cereal recipe</h2><p>If you want to try out something new for breakfast, brunch or even dessert, this <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">recipe</a> from <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Cafe Delites</a> hits the spot any time of day. For a helpful piping tip, the smaller you make them, the crispier they get. And if you have leftovers, we have an easy, chef-approved trick for <a href=#>reheating pancakes</a>.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Pancake Cereal</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/03/pancake-cereal-2.jpg><p><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p><ul><li>1&nbsp;cup&nbsp;all purpose flour</li><li>2&nbsp;Tbs.&nbsp;granulated sugar or sweetener</li><li>2&nbsp;tsp.&nbsp;baking powder</li><li>¬Ω tsp.&nbsp;salt</li><li>¬æ&nbsp;cup&nbsp;milk, plus more if needed</li><li>2&nbsp;Tbs.&nbsp;melted butter</li><li>1&nbsp;tsp.&nbsp;pure vanilla extract</li><li>1&nbsp;large&nbsp;egg</li></ul><p><strong>Directions:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Active Time:</strong> 10 minutes</li><li><strong>Total Time:</strong> 20 minutes</li><li><strong>Yield: </strong>2 servings</li></ul><li>First, combine flour, sugar, baking powder and salt in a large bowl.&nbsp;Then make a well in the center and add the milk, slightly cooled melted butter, vanilla and egg.</li><li>With a whisk, mix the wet ingredients together first before slowly folding them into the dry ingredients. Combine until smooth and lump-free. Then add 1-2 extra Tbs. of milk if needed to slightly thin the batter. Importantly, you don‚Äôt want to it too runny.</li><li>Let your pancake batter sit for about 5 minutes while heating a nonstick pan or griddle over medium-high heat. Then lightly grease the pan.</li><li>Pour pancake batter into a squeezable condiment/sauce bottle. (Alternatively, use a zip-top bag: cut a tiny hole on an angle in the bottom corner of the bag to pipe out the batter.)</li><li>With the bottle tilted, squeeze small dots of batter onto the hot pan. Then cook until the tops form bubbles and look set/dry. Flip with a small spatula and cook until golden on the undersides, about 1-2 minutes. Repeat with remaining batter, lightly greasing the pan between each batch. Finally, pour pancakes into a bowl, add toppings and serve immediately.</li><p><strong>Note: </strong>For crispy edges, grease pan with oil, and for softer pancakes, use butter.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Fun pancake cereal topping ideas</h2><p>A perfect bowl of pancake cereal doesn‚Äôt just include the pancakes. You can create your own masterpiece using ingredients in your kitchen that‚Äôs as delicious as it is photo-worthy. Pour in a splash of milk, or get creative with these fun topping ideas.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>1. Fresh fruit</h3><p>Pancakes and fruit undoubtedly go hand in hand. Sliced strawberries, bananas, blueberries and raspberries add natural sweetness, freshness and a bright pop of color.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>2. Nut butters</h3><p>A generous spoonful of nut butter brings a rich, creamy element to your bite. Try a dollop of peanut butter, almond butter or cashew butter.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>3. Chocolate chips</h3><p>While chocolate chips may be too big for pancake cereal, that doesn‚Äôt mean you can‚Äôt add them to your bowl. If you want, go all-out tiny with a bag of miniature chips.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>4. Syrups + honey</h3><p>A drizzle of syrup can go a long way. Go the classic route with maple syrup, or try honey, chocolate syrup or caramel syrup for a sticky-sweet coating.</p><p><strong>For more on pancakes,</strong> check out these stories:</p><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Pioneer Woman‚Äôs Secret to Fluffy Pancakes: Just Use a Sheet Pan ‚Äî No Flipping Needed!</a></p><p><a href=#>Pancake Day: How This Pre-Lent Tradition Came About + 2 Delicious Flapjack Recipes</a></p><p><a href=#>Muffin Mix Pancakes Are the 3-Ingredient Secret to a Deliciously Easy Breakfast</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7p7XRrKufp6KsvK6xzWeaqKVfpby0wNJonainlGK%2Fpq%2FIqZysZ6CWu6Styp5knJ2imq6tedGemqKolQ%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./longleaf-tea-company.html><span>‚Üê</span><span>Longleaf Tea Company Tour &amp;amp; Tastings Laurel Mercantile</span></a>
