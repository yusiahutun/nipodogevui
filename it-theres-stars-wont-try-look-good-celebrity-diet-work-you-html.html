If you're blood type A, you should eat a mainly vegetarian diet low in fat and high in carbs.<br></p><p>Type Bs should eat a varied diet, including meat and dairy, while type AB can eat most foods recommended for both A and B blood types.<br></p><p><span style=font-weight:700>URSULA SAYS:</span> It might sound as if it's rooted in science, but there's no strong evidence to suggest that differences between blood types have a noticeable effect on digestion.<br></p><p>Some people have allergies and sensitivities to certain foods, but there's nothing to suggest that this is related to blood groups.<br></p><p><span style=font-weight:700>STEVE SAYS: </span>Cutting entire food groups out of your diet arbitrarily could result in you being deficient in certain essential vitamins and minerals, so a diet like this, which has no credible basis, is not advisable.<br></p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/05/10/article-1275908-0975B5A9000005DC-852_233x431.jpg height=431 width=233 alt="Cindy Crawford" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>Complicated diet plan: Cindy Crawford</p><p style=font-weight:700><span style=color:#d42699><span>CINDY CRAWFORD</span></span></p><p>The supermodel is a fan of The Zone Diet, when everything you eat is in the ratio of 40 per cent carbohydrates, 30 per cent protein and 30 per cent fat.<br></p><p>The diet bans sugar, bread, pasta, rice, alcohol and caffeine.<br></p><p>It also recommends you restrict high-sugar fruit and vegetables, such as papaya, mango and carrots.<br></p><p>And alongside your three main meals, you have two mini-meals to maintain blood sugar levels.<br></p><p><span style=font-weight:700>URSULA SAYS: </span>Three meals and two snacks is a sensible way to eat, as long as it is nutritious.<br></p><p>The diet demands that you keep the proportions for every meal and snack.<br></p><p>Calculating something like this is a bit of a faff if you don't have your own personal chef.<br></p><p><span style=font-weight:700>STEVE SAYS:</span> If things are complicated, you're more likely to fall off the wagon.<br></p><p>There are far better ways to spend your time than measuring out exact ratios of food.<br></p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/05/10/article-1275908-0975B626000005DC-160_233x423.jpg height=423 width=233 alt="Claudia Schiffer" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>Cuts out alcohol: Claudia Schiffer</p><p style=font-weight:700><span style=color:#d42699><span>CLAUDIA SCHIFFER</span></span></p><p>Unlike many irritating celebs who insist they eat whatever they like, Claudia admits she has to work hard for her body.<br></p><p>She doesn't drink alcohol, steers clear of caffeine and exercises regularly. She doesn't believe in dieting as it messes up your metabolism, but has her own rigid healthy eating plan.<br></p><p>She eats only fruit and vegetables before noon, has a light lunch of salad, vegetables or soup, and for dinner has a chicken or tuna salad, or grilled chicken and steamed veg.</p><p><span style=font-weight:700>URSULA SAYS: </span>There's something to be said for sticking to a regime rather than yo-yo dieting, as studies in animals suggest that fluctuating weight can have an adverse effect on health.<br></p><p>Cutting out alcohol stops you taking in calories that aren't accompanied by any nutritional benefits.<br></p><p><span style=font-weight:700>STEVE SAYS:</span> This isn't a diet I'd advocate for most people because if you're only eating fruit in the mornings, you might not get enough fibre and carbs, and could find your blood sugar levels dropping in the afternoon.<br></p><p>Whole fruit is far preferable to fruit juice - the former provides fibre while the latter is really just sugar.</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/05/09/article-1275908-0975B430000005DC-410_233x490.jpg height=490 width=233 alt="Strict regime: Heidi Klum" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>Strict regime: Heidi Klum</p><p style=font-weight:700><span style=color:#d42699><span>HEIDI KLUM</span></span></p><p>The supermodel is a fan of a strict regime called the Ultimate New York Body Plan, which she used to get back into catwalk shape six weeks after the birth of her second child.<br></p><p>Alcohol, bread, starchy carbs, caffeine, dairy, sweets, fruit and most fats are totally forbidden. You consume no more than 1,200 calories a day in the form of lean protein, vegetables, and healthy fats, such as flaxseed oil, olive oil, pumpkin seeds and sunflower seeds.<br></p><p>You eat every three hours to boost your metabolism, and you must exercise for 90 minutes a day.
