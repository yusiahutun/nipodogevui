Another photo showed rows of Country Garden employees making a toast.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The Chinese tradition of drinking chicken blood symbolises brotherhood and is reflected in the term “pumping chicken blood”, which means “insanity” or “excitement”.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn4.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2018/07/18/8063b07e-8a3c-11e8-8608-b7163509a377_1320x770_232322.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">But Country Garden sales team member Huang Xiaolin said the toast was with soda, according to the report.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“It is way too inhumane for them to drink chicken blood,” Huang was quoted as saying. “And there are parasites in the blood – it is impossible to drink it.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The One Hand video website also posted a clip online quoting an unnamed Country Garden employee as saying the photo with the chicken was a stunt.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“We just happened to have a cleaner who brought the chicken to the company to be cooked,” the man was quoted as saying. “The workers then used the chicken for a fun photo stunt.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Country Garden declined a request for comment from the South China Morning Post.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Hong Kong’s Department of Health said raw poultry and poultry products, including chicken blood, could contain or be contaminated with various kinds of human pathogens such as bacteria and bird flu viruses.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Consumption of raw or undercooked poultry products could lead to food poisoning or other serious infections such as bird flu, a department spokesman said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Founded in 1992, Country Garden is based in Guangdong province and had a market value of US$7.6 billion last year, with various developments in other countries, including Malaysia and Australia.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Blood-drinking rituals hit the headlines last year when a car dealership in Sichuan province held a ceremony for staff. The dealership’s manager said the employees volunteered to down animal blood.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Other companies have come in for attention for other staff rituals. In May, employees at a firm in Yichang, Hubei province, were made to crawl around like dogs and slapped over their poor work performance while workers at a real estate company in the same area were made to dance on the street for similar reasons.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51ku6bD0miaoaGelny0u8KinK2xX5a%2FtbXCpZxoamFqgnl%2Bj2iaoaGToLKvecGlpqicXai8triMnJ%2BippWosm6%2BxJqjZp2jqa61sYyfoKulXZmyr7XErGSappmirq150aKrrpmc</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./brad-mondo-xmondo-hair-color.html><span>←</span><span>Brad Mondo XMondo Hair Color Is Here to Boost Your At-Home Hue</span></a>
