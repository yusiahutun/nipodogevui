Victoria also lacked buccal corridors, before she had her smile overhaul. Buccal corridors are when you show eight to ten teeth when you smile, for a wide, attractive grin. Before her dental makeover, when Victoria smiled everything was focused on the front teeth, with the back teeth not showing as much.</p><p id=epTjijdYsg data-wc=14><strong>MORE:&nbsp;</strong><a class=hm-link href=#>Victoria Beckham's one no-go food she keeps away from her super strict diet</a><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p id=el0wazXgrj data-wc=15><strong>MORE:&nbsp;<a class=hm-link href=#>Helen Mirren shares ‘uncomfortable’ career moment that inspired her to break the beauty ‘rules’</a></strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/b62fdc802cd9-victoria-beckham-smiling.jpg><p id=eaIknSeqt1y data-wc=53>If you compare Victoria's picture-perfect 2021 smile to pictures of the star from her Spice Girls days, the expert claimed it's likely VB has had porcelain veneers. "The shapes and proportions of the teeth have completely changed, and so has her bite, so it's likely she's had the top and bottom teeth done."</p><p id=eL9K-xqvZRc data-wc=40>The dentist also explained that Victoria's new teeth are key to preserving her age-defying looks. Dr. Rhona explained that Victoria has a long upper lip length, which measures the base of the nose to the upper part of the lip.</p><figure class=videoPlayerClass_v1tejlff>WATCH: Victoria Beckham's teeth explained by top dentist</figure><p id=eD_O0J8r8gx data-wc=31>As we age this area gets longer, which can make us look older.

"Some people try to achieve this with orthodontic treatment such as braces, but because the shapes and colour of Victoria Beckham's teeth have changed, we can see she's had veneers because this can't be achieved with braces and whitening alone."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfnbKiuNOhmKeckpqutsDYaJ%2BemZyptW6tzZ1kn6Gko7K0v45uaGlxY2x8t7XCraaroZFir6avyqGYpqtdlrSmecOenbKhnpx6tbHErZ9mrKKWu7SyzqukmqyZpLtuv8ScqZ6so2KvprTIp5tmsZ%2Bqwamy1KVkr52emrKzv44%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./forrest-earl-s-interview-slated-execution-html.html><span>←</span><span>Forrest Earl's last interview before his slated execution</span></a>
