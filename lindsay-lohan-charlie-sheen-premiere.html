When the actress finally swept along&nbsp;the red carpet, Charlie, 47, showed there were no hard feelings as he planted a kiss on his co-star's cheek. Lindsay, who will soon be heading back to rehab, put her recent troubles to one side and looked glamorous in a flattering <strong>Dolce and Gabbana</strong> dress. The starlet had braided her hair at the temples and let her mane hang loose over one shoulder. Lindsay and Charlie both star in the spoof horror comedy , now in its fifth instalment. "She's really happy to be here," the actress's rep told gathered reporters.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/5cb04eac3182-lilo-kiss-z.jpg><p id=e74rCMAOJTq2 data-wc=134>Lindsay also starred in an episode of Charlie's hit US show and the actor joked that she had the set "held hostage" when she appeared on the show. He told US chat show host <strong>Jay Leno</strong>, "Day one was fabulous. She was on time, she knew her lines, hit every mark, made us look off our game. And then we had to deal with day two." The actor&nbsp;went on to explain&nbsp;that Lindsay was late on the second day due to an ear ache. "It was as though she had us held hostage because she gave us half a show," he joked. "She was really not feeling well. We just worked around it. She was late, what can I say? But when she got there, she was prepared. With an excuse."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/c076248daf6e-li-lo-carpet-z.jpg><p id=eS5bGGfTyUfZ data-wc=74>The former star has had his fair share of controversy and recently admitted he sees himself as a mentor to Lindsay, who is currently facing 90 days in rehab as part of a plea deal in a car crash case. Last year he lent Lindsay $100,000 to pay off an outstanding tax bill, and earlier this year he bought the actress a dress to wear to the amfAR Gala.</p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
