Although their mother is an icon in the acting world, they had absolutely no idea when they were young. She’s explained why and revealed it all on her first appearance on <a href=#>celebrity</a> panel show, The View.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2024/01/GettyImages-618922254-1024x767.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-jodie-foster-s-son-thought-she-was-a-construction-worker>Jodie Foster’s son thought she was a ‘construction worker’</h2><p>The 61-year-old has been acting since she was just three years old, with her first gig being in a Coppertone ad. She then stormed Hollywood, appearing in <a href=#>movies</a> such as Taxi Driver and Panic Room.</p><p>Being in the spotlight all her life, it’s no wonder she wanted a feel of normality, which is what she did with her children, keeping what she did for a living away from them.</p><p>Speaking on her decision to The View panel, the mom of two said: “I don’t know why, I guess I just didn’t want them to know me that way. I wanted them to know me as their mom and the person who went away to work and stuff. I just didn’t want them to be confused about what I did for a living.”</p><p>In fact, her eldest actually thought she was a construction worker. Sharing the funny anecdote, the Freaky Friday star explained how she took Charles to set when he was just three years old.</p><p>“I brought him to set one day and I bought him a little plastic tool belt and stuff. And I was like, ‘Yeah, and this is this set and this set and this set,'” she laughed, before revealing he thought she was a construction worker for the “longest time.”</p><p>Of course, her two boys, whom she shares with her former partner, Cydney Bernard, are fully aware of her job now, and have been seen attending events and Red Carpets with their mom.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-the-star-turned-down-princess-leia-role>The star ‘turned down’ Princess Leia role</h2><p>Another iconic role could have been added to the star’s list, as she was offered the role as Princess Leia in the late 1970s. However, revealed she had to turn it down.</p><p>“They were going for a younger Princess Leia but I had a conflict,” Foster recently revealed on The Tonight Show With Jimmy Fallon. I was doing a Disney movie and I just didn’t want to pull out of the Disney movie because I was already under contract.”</p><p>However, she praised Carrie Fisher for her “amazing job” in the role and revealed she didn’t know ‘how good’ she would have been at the role herself.</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFtZmlpX2d%2BcLbOnaCeZZakwLWx0axkrKeeYsGpu9Sgn61lo52ybsPArGSaZZOku7TA0a6araGfo3q4u9GknKtllqS%2FbsXEmqmsZw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./interop-2024-votes.html><span>←</span><span>Interop 2024 Votes Chris Coyier</span></a>
