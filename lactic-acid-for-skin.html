"They can remove blemishes, fade sunspots, improve skin tone, texture, reduce hyperpigmentation and superficial wrinkles."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In the case of lactic acid, it can be used as both an anti-aging and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>acne treatment</a> because it exfoliates, improves fine lines and wrinkles, and improves the appearance of discoloration.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Michelle Wong, cosmetic chemist and founder of <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Lab Muffin</a> points out that while lactic acid is an exfoliant, it's also a hydrating humectant. "It can hydrate your skin, reduce clogged pores, smooth out skin texture and help fade pigment," she says.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-who-should-use-lactic-acid></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Who Should Use Lactic Acid?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_19-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">For sensitive skin types, lactic acid can be a great chemical exfoliant because it's gentler than other AHA and BHA acids.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_21-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Lactic acid is best used on sensitive skin because it is a mild exfoliant which will not disrupt the pH of the skin or cause redness and irritation," Dr. Green says.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_23-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Because lactic acid has a larger molecule size in comparison to other AHA acids, it doesn't penetrate the skin as deeply, providing a more superficial exfoliation. In other words, lactic acid isn't as potent, but it can still be effective, which is ideal for sensitive skin types that are prone to irritation.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-what-ingredients-dont-play-nice-with-lactic-acid></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_27-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What Ingredients Don't Play Nice With Lactic Acid?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_28-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Lactic acid should not be used in conjunction with other forms of AHA's or in addition to using BHA's, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>retinols</a> or tretinoin," Dr. Green shares. "These ingredients all cause cell turnover and some degree of exfoliation. When combined together, they can cause severe skin irritation."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_30-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Wong says that because lactic acid products are at a low pH, they can conflict with pH-sensitive ingredients such as peptides. "Usually it's not a big problem if you wait 15 minutes between applying products," she says.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-how-should-you-use-lactic-acid-in-your-skincare-routine></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_32-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>How Should You Use Lactic Acid in Your Skincare Routine</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_33-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">There are a number of products infused with lactic acid, from cleansers to serums to face masks. While which one you try is up to you, it's always best to consult with a dermatologist if you're unsure about adding anything new to your existing routine.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_35-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Just don't forget to apply SPF every morning, because like other exfoliants, lactic acid can cause sun sensitivity.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_37-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Lactic acid is also a melanin suppressor therefore it inhibits tyrosinase which is the enzyme responsible for melanin production," Dr. Green says. "Because it decreases your melanin production, you should wear sunscreen and protective clothing to protect the treated areas from sun damage."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_39-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Due to this reduction in melanin production, Dr. Green says the skin is "noticeably healthier, lighter, and brighter almost immediately."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_41-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>VIDEO: When You Apply Sunscreen in Your Skincare Routine Actually Matters A Lot</strong></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-the-5-best-lactic-acid-products></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_45-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>The 5 Best Lactic Acid Products</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_46-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Philosophy Renewed Hope in A Jar Facial Moisturizer</span></h3><figure id=mntl-sc-block_47-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-square figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Courtesy</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_48-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Dr. Green is a fan of Philosophy's classic moisturizer because it's lightweight and filled with lactic acid and antioxidants.
