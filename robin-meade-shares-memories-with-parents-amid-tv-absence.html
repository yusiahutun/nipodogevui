In her time away from <a href=#>TV</a>, the newscaster has been spending time with her friends and making “fond memories” with her family.&nbsp;</span></p><p dir=ltr><span class="x_x_ContentPasted0 x_ContentPasted0">“What yearly family event did you take for granted, but now cherish like gold? The first ‘mess of green beans’ each year is a BIG DEAL for the Meades,” Robin, 54, recently wrote in a rare post on Instagram. “Dad plants and picks them. Mom preps and pressure cooks them. Everyone else’s job? To eat them. LOL.”</span></p><p dir=ltr><span class="x_x_ContentPasted0 x_ContentPasted0">In the carousel of photos from the family affair, Robin posed with her mom and dad as they prepared for the annual celebration.&nbsp;</span></p><p dir=ltr><span class="x_x_ContentPasted0 x_ContentPasted0">“I’m so grateful to see these two last weekend learning to handle their newly renovated kitchen ‘like a boss,’” the post continued. “But mostly, a year after Dad’s health scare and years after Mom tackled her own, having them with us and thriving is a cause for celebration every day.”</span></p><p dir=ltr><span class="x_x_ContentPasted0 x_ContentPasted0">Robin finished off the post “hoping” her fans were able to “make fond memories with loved ones” just as she has been able to do with her parents. The longtime broadcaster also revealed the hilarious gift she got for her father — a shirt that reads “You can’t scare me; I have two daughters.”</span></p><p dir=ltr>&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Robin-Meade-Shares-‘Memories-With-Parents-Amid-TV-Absence.jpg><p dir=ltr><span class="x_x_ContentPasted0 x_ContentPasted0">Prior to sharing the sweet photos with her parents, Robin had a little reunion with some of her former talk show costars, including <strong>Susan Hendricks</strong>, <strong>Bob Van Dillen</strong>, <strong>Shyann Malone</strong>, <strong>Melissa Knowles</strong>, <strong>Elizabeth Prann</strong> and <strong>Kristina Fitzpatrick</strong>. The group spent time at The Splatter Studio, an immersive painting experience.&nbsp;</span></p><p dir=ltr><span class="x_x_ContentPasted0 x_ContentPasted0">“Former morning show anchors reunion!” Robin captioned a May 17 post. “Expressing ourselves … via paint? LOL. I missed these folks, so we got together (for the first time as a group since our show ended in early December).”&nbsp;</span></p><p dir=ltr><span class="x_x_ContentPasted0 x_ContentPasted0">The comments section was flooded with love from fans who have missed seeing all of the anchors on air together.&nbsp;</span></p><p dir=ltr><span class="x_x_ContentPasted0 x_ContentPasted0">“I have still not adjusted to you being taken off air,” one fan commented on the post. “BEST NEWS CREW.”&nbsp;</span></p><p dir=ltr><span class="x_x_ContentPasted0 x_ContentPasted0">Another penned, “I miss everyone, you had the best news team,” adding, “What a big mistake.”</span></p><p dir=ltr><span class="x_x_ContentPasted0 x_ContentPasted0">While Robin has yet to announce her next career venture, it’s clear she has a huge support system thanks to her family, friends and fans.&nbsp;</span></p><p dir=ltr><span class="x_x_ContentPasted0 x_ContentPasted0">“So many people are lost without you and your crew!” another person commented. “I hope that you are all doing well and here’s hoping that we can see you all together again. That was a major mistake.”</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46rppuhnmK6pq3DnmSsoJGnsrR5zJ6kqKqZmsBuw8itn2aokaeyr8DSZpimoZRiwbd5wJuqnqaTmnw%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./frances-bean-cobain-photos.html><span>←</span><span>Photos of Kurt Cobain &amp;amp; Courtney Loves Daughter Hollywood Life</span></a>
