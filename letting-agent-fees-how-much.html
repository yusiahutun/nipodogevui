It has a range of fees, starting with £420 for administration and £165 for an end of tenancy inventory check.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/nintchdbpict000255313260.jpg><p>Tenants could also be charged £65 for renewing their contract or £300 to change a name mid-term.</p><p>If you forget to pay your rent then you’ll get whacked with a £60 fee and any future references will incur a £60 charge.</p><p>A spokesperson from Foxtons said: "This was an unexpected announcement and the details and timing of the new policy are not yet known.</p><p>“As we get more clarity, we will review the impact to our customers and on our business."<br></p><h3>HAMPTONS</h3><p>Another of the big agents, Hamptons, has over 85 offices across the UK. It was started in 1830 when William Hampton opened a shop in Cranbourn Street in London, first selling furniture.</p><p>It charges £250 for admin but a further £125 for a reference, £25 for “right to rent” and £135.80 for inventory checks.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/nintchdbpict0002842914062.jpg><p>Other fees include £75 for leaving a contract early and £30 for references for future landlords.</p><p>It will also charge you two very confusing fees when you renew a contract. An initial £90 tenancy renewal memorandum and then a second charge of £150 to change the contract.</p><p>The Sun Online contacted Hamptons for a comment.<br></p><h3>KNIGHT FRANK</h3><p>The international agents, Knight Frank, have 411 offices in 59 countries and employ 14,000 people, including branches in England, Scotland and Wales.</p><p>It charges&nbsp;a £276 admin fee, a slightly lower fee of £48 for references but levies a £48 fee for protecting your deposit (a legal requirement) and £48 if you need a guarantor for a contract.</p><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">Key points from the Autumn Statement</h3></p><p class=article__content--intro>Here are the Chancellor's proposed changes</p><p><strong>National Living Wage increase</strong> National Living Wage <a href=# rel=noopener>rises by 30p an hour</a> giving £500 more a year to lowest paid Brits</p><p><strong>Rip-off rental fees banned</strong><br>Share prices of estate agents crashed this morning ahead of Philip Hammond's <a href=# rel=noopener>crack-down on fees</a></p><p><strong>£3.5bn housing investment</strong><br>Government to inject £1.4bn into affordable housing and another <a href=# rel=noopener>£2.3bn into areas of 'high demand'</a></p><p><strong>U-turn on cuts to Universal Credits</strong><br>Cash back for three million workers as Chancellor <a href=# rel=noopener>reverses cuts to benefits</a></p><p><strong>Fuel duty frozen for another two years</strong><br>The Chancellor won't implement the planned<a href=# rel=noopener> 2p-per-litre rise</a></p><p><strong>£1.1bn investment into super-fast internet</strong><br>The money will fund 5G mobile networks and <a href=# rel=noopener>extension of fibre-optic broadband networks</a></p><p><strong>Income tax-free personal allowance to rise</strong><br>The tax-free personal allowance will rise £1,500 <a href=# rel=noopener>to £12,500</a></p><p><strong>New NS&I savings bond announced</strong><br>NS&I to launch new savings bond with a rate of 2.2%<a href=# rel=noopener>from Spring next year</a></p><p><strong>Insurance premiums to increase</strong><br>Insurance premiums to go up after Chancellor announces <a href=# rel=noopener>two per cent hike in tax</a></p><p><a href=# rel=noopener>For all the latest, visit our liveblog</a></p><p>It also charges £267 if you need to change the names on the contract, e.g, if you were to leave early and find a replacement.</p><p>The Sun Online contacted Knight Frank for a comment.</p><h3>LUDLOW THOMPSON</h3><p>Ludlow Thompson was established in 1993. It charges a £420 admin fee and a whopping £432 if you decide to move out and need to change the name on a contract.</p><p>A mid-term inspection fee of £141.60 is also levied, while inventory checks cost £114.40.</p><p>If you want to renew your tenancy then you’ll get charged £114.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/nintchdbpict000269840986.jpg><p>Stephen Ludlow, chairman at Ludlow Thompson, said: "There is a risk that, as a result, some letting agencies will cut back on investment in marketing , training and quality control which that could reduce stock leading to an increase in rents and a reduction in customer service delivery."</p><p>"Without reputable letting agents fully committed to the sector we will potentially see more lettings back in the hands of unregulated private landlords, and leaving tenants with far lower levels of protection than at present."</p><p><b>We pay for your stories!
