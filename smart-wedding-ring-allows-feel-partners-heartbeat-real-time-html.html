The £400 HB Ring lets you feel your partner's heartbeat in real time just by tapping it twice.&nbsp;
As long as your partner's phone is connected to the internet, your ring will pulse in the same pattern as your partner's heart.&nbsp;
It also flashes a red line around the edge to animate the heartbeat like a&nbsp;hospital electrocardiogram, making it a quirky alternative to the classic gold wedding ring."><meta name=author content="Reinaldo Massengill"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>
