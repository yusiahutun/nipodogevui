And the Barbie star arrived on the 2024 Oscars red carpet in an ensemble that did not disappoint. Although Ferrera didn't technically play a Barbie in the box office phenomenon, the actress arrived in looking like one on the red carpet.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Ferrera went full Barbie in a bubblegum-pink chainmail Versace gown with a square-and-sweetheart-hybrid neckline, tapered waist, and floor-skimming skirt. She accessorized with a ruby-and-diamond choker necklace, stud earrings, and a giant bauble ring.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_6-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In terms of glam, Ferrera styled her sleek bob with a deep side-part and flippy ends, and she kept her makeup simple with shimmery shadow and a light pink lip.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The actress was also joined on the red carpet by her husband Ryan Piers Williams, who played her hubby on screen, as well.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Ferrera earned her nomination for her role as Gloria in the blockbuster hit of the year, which received a total of eight nominations this year. The actress also received recognition alongside her co-star Ryan Gosling, who <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>played Ken in the film</a>.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Noticeably missing from the ballot were the leading ladies behind the movie: director Greta Gerwig and Barbie herself, Margot Robbie. Many fans pointed out that the snub was <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>antithetical to the film's message</a>, and Ferrera spoke about their lack of nominations in an interview with <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>Variety</a> following the announcement, saying she “was incredibly disappointed that they weren’t nominated."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_17-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Regardless of her disappointment, Ferrera told <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>People </a>that she was "so moved" to be nominated individually. "I’m stunned and so moved to be nominated among the brilliant artists who have done beautiful and important work this year," she said in a statement. "And I’m so proud to get to bring Latiné representation to this year's Academy Awards, along with my fellow Latiné nominees. May the diversity of voices acknowledged by the Academy continue to grow!"</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_19-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I’m thrilled to celebrate my phenomenal Barbie family and all their achievements," she continued. "Greta Gerwig and Margot Robbie made history and raised the bar with&nbsp;Barbie. The cultural and industry impact they’ve achieved will be felt for generations, and I’m so thankful to them for asking me to be a part of it."<br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57wKacq6GTlnqnsdGrnKuZXZeus67InmSpoZ6geqi71qdkqKuTlr%2B0eZFpaW1laGt9d32Rbg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./kate-middleton-prince-william-wedding-security-cost-revealed.html><span>←</span><span>Will Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's royal wedding follow suit from Prince William and Kate's?</span></a>
