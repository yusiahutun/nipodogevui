So it was really special for our whole family to be involved too. The kids are so proud of their dad and the &nbsp;girls have been arguing over who gets to take Rob's medal to school first so they can show their friends and teachers. And doing it at Headingly, which is like a second home to Rob and Kevin, meant so much to them. Kev knew he was getting his award that day but Rob didn’t, so it was a lovely surprise.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/aaad45090908-gettyimages-1917402277.jpg><p id=eBXpUEEu9NA data-wc=92>"The girls were so excited, but Jackson was more interested in playing with my phone. But William was absolutely lovely and really engaged with the kids and asked Jackson which game he was playing. He obviously knows what five-year-old boys are like because he has one of his own. It was the first time Rob had met William and he was so genuine and sincere. He was really invested in hearing about Rob and Kevin's campaign and the story of how they grew up together when they were playing for Leeds Rhinos."</p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
