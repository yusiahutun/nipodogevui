However, a <a href=#>royal</a> author has claimed the duke was upset over ‘alterations’ ahead of the scheduled appearance. <a href=#>Prince Harry</a>‘s military uniform apparently had items removed from the setup because he’s no longer working for The Firm. Despite “heated” phone calls on deaf ears, the dad-of-two almost lost hope. However, <a href=#>Prince William</a> stepped up to show ‘support’ for his younger brother.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-heated-phone-calls-from-prince-harry-over-his-military-uniform>‘Heated’ phone calls from Prince Harry over his military uniform</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2024/01/GettyImages-960045560-1024x683.jpg><p><a href=#>Omid Scobie, who wrote Endgame</a>: Inside the Royal Family and the Monarchy’s fight for survival, touched on the occasion in his bombshell book. He says Prince Harry was upset his military uniform was ‘altered’ before it arrived ahead of the vigil. But older brother <a href=#>William stepped up in despite of their feud</a> to keep the peace, as such.</p><p>Omid Scobie wrote: “Harry was initially told he was not permitted to wear his military uniform, despite his status as a decorated war veteran.</p><p>“He knew his grandmother would have wanted him to, but it took a number of emails and conversations before King Charles relented and gave special dispensation for Harry to wear his Blues and Royals, Number 1 dress attire.”</p><p>However, Scobie then claims when his uniform arrived, the Queen’s ‘ER’ initials were missing from the shoulder epaulettes, as well as the agiuillette, the ornamental braided cord. He alleged someone from the palace had removed them due to him no longer being a senior royal and losing his <a href=#>official titles</a>.</p><p>But his uncle, Prince Andrew, had worn his full military uniform for a vigil by the Queen’s coffin two days earlier. This is despite the royal also having his official titles removed.</p><p>Scobie says “heated phone calls were made, but palace officials refused to make any changes”.</p><p>That’s where William steps in. The author adds: “William would remove his aiguilette to make things a little more equal,” and it changed Harry’s mind.</p><p>“It was a rare show of support from his brother and a source said he appreciated”.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-harry-completed-two-tours-in-afghanistan>Harry completed two tours in Afghanistan</h2><p>The Duke, whose journey into the army began in 2004, started training as an Officer Cadet in May 2005.</p><p>Prince Harry even opened up about his Passing Out parade – the official graduation from military academy – while dressed up in his uniform in 2006. In his memoir, Spare, he spoke of how his grandmother – the Queen – inspected the 220 cadets, as per tradition. But when she walked past her grandson, she couldn’t help but smile ear-to-ear.</p><p>After grueling training, he became an armored reconnaissance troop leader. He rejoined his regiment in Windsor in October 2006, being responsible for 11 soldiers and four vehicles.</p><p>In late 2007, he began serving in Helmand, Afghanistan, before being promoted to Lieutenant with The Household Cavalry (Blues and Royals) the following year. He completed two tours, first, as a Forward Air Controller between 2007 and 2008, and then as an Apache Pilot from 2012 and 2013.</p><p>He was then promoted to a rank of Captain in 2011. The now 39-year-old served in the army for ten years.</p><p>Despite his serve to the crown and army, Prince Harry is not permitted to wear his military uniform at events as he is not a working member of The Firm. Also, his titles, Captain General Royal Marines, Honorary Air Commandant, RAF Honington, and Commodore-in-Chief, Small Ships and Diving, Royal Naval Command to Queen Elizabeth II, were stripped.</p><p>The decision came in February 2021, a year after he and <a href=#>Meghan Markle</a> left the UK for America.</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFtZmlpX2V%2BcLzRoqWcnV2drrO%2B2KxkpqGcnsGivthmrKehlqS%2FrnnWmqpmmZypsrOxw2aZrqxdrLatuMiapGarpJq9sbHDZqCnZaSkerS0zrBkrK2gpbyzwI4%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./howard-stern-listened-to-serial-killers-confession-for-17-minutes-live-on-air.html><span>←</span><span>Howard Stern listened to 'serial killer's confession' for 17 minutes live on air</span></a>
