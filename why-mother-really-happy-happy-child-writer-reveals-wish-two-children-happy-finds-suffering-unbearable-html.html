Often, once they've unloaded their woes on to you, they feel much better, leaving you feeling much worse.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>My daughter was once very miserable about falling out with a close friend. I called her from work to check on her.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>'I'm fine, Mum, I'm a bit busy right now.' 'But earlier you said…' 'Oh that, yeah, it's all sorted now.'</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>She was breezy, if anything, a little irritated that I'd brought it up and was circling above her, helicopter parent-style. I resolved to try to have a few more boundaries - to listen to my children's concerns without always having to absorb them. It's a work in progress.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>The parent-child relationship is, perhaps inevitably, a co-dependent one.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>As the child of a volatile mother, I used to tentatively sniff the atmosphere arriving home from school to get a sense of how the emotional land lay; now as a mother, I tiptoe around the fragile earth of my own children's emotional landscape.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>I send them anxious messages asking how they are and then, all too often, I'm upset when they tell me. So accustomed have my children become to offloading their miseries onto me, that they sometimes forget to tell me their good news. My son, who is back living at home because he can't afford not to, has been having something of a late-20s crisis over where his life is going.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>Our most recent conversation found him rather low.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>This week, however, my daughter breezily asked me whether I'd heard his 'great news?'</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>'Er…no,' I said.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>'He's got this great new venture he's really excited about.'</span></p><img id=i-a3e58495c1a01263 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2015/09/16/01/2C581B3800000578-3236161-image-m-47_1442363086336.jpg height=447 width=634 alt="Olivia is pictured cuddling Oscar, then aged eight, and a beaming Francesca, four, on a set of steps in 1997" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>Olivia is pictured cuddling Oscar, then aged eight, and a beaming Francesca, four, on a set of steps in 1997</p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>Despite the fact he'd neglected to tell me himself, I felt my whole mood lighten.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>Perhaps our children face bigger problems than we did at their age.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>They live in a time of fierce academic competition, a highly competitive job market, the ubiquity of drugs, the threat of violence and the problems of unaffordable housing.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>They're often still living at home at a time when we'd long since been in a position to leave and set up our own households.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>We know far too much about our children's lives and, thanks to technology, are constantly in touch with them. We witness their relationship make-ups and break-ups and it's hard not to be affected by them.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>I wondered whether men are only as happy as their least happy child. My husband, Simon, said he's been too infected by my reactions to be objective, but he thinks the whole generation is unhappy.</span></p>It's as they grow older and their emotions inevitably become more complex and wide-ranging that the troubles really begin because we don't always know the right answers<p class=mol-para-with-font><span>I asked our friend, Richard, who has three grown-up children whether his happiness was dependent on them. 'No,' he said philosophically, 'I mean, who's happy in their 20s?'</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>Not that this attitude is gender- specific. I overheard another friend, Lizzie, talking to her 24-year-old daughter Scarlett the other night. Scarlett was upset because her car had broken down on the motorway and she was waiting for roadside assistance.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>'What do you expect me to do about it?' Lizzie said coolly. 'It's late and they'll be there soon. Just phone me when you get home.'</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>I'd have been mounting a rescue operation or keeping my daughter on the telephone until help arrived.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>The truth, however difficult, is it's important to remind oneself not to be ruled by emotions; it's not simply a question of happiness or sadness, but more one about the importance of learning life lessons.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>That way we can help children become adults who can trust themselves and their decisions.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>Meanwhile, I still really want my two children to be as happy as they can possibly be.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>Preferably, both at the same time.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pa3IpbCmmZmhe6S7ja6iaJ6Voq6quI6aqa2hk6Gybn%2BRbG1qbmFkpKnFjKamraCVp3qzscClo7JlmJa9scWMoZipqKlisKm1y51kkKqZqbKzedGerZ6ZnKh6uLXSoWStr59isKm1y52pnqZdna6xvNhmnaKmlKh6tMHFn5yroZ6cera6wZ6Yq5mSobJvtNOmow%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./the-ultimate-laurel-bucket-list.html><span>←</span><span>The Perfect One-Day Itinerary in Downtown Laurel Laurel Mercantile</span></a>
