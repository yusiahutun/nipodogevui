He has been dubbed the unluckiest royal in love, particularly following the breakdown of his marriage from ex-wife <a class=hm-link href=# rel=noopener>Autumn Phillips</a> in 2019, with whom he shares <a class=hm-link href=# rel=noopener>two daughters Savannah, 13, and Isla, 12</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/7f9b0361a577-gettyimages-50731476.jpg><h2><strong>Peter a 'sounding board' for cousin William</strong></h2><p id=ee8hk6T9mBp data-wc=54>But his love life aside – more on that later – Peter, 46, is very much loved by the royal family. From a young age, he clearly forged a strong bond with his cousin William, five years his junior, and has gone on to enjoy a similarly close relationship with his cousin-in-law Princess Kate.</p><p id=eHc3zMXv2kK data-wc=51>"I think <strong>he has great respect and admiration for William</strong>, who does have that pressure, and in future, Peter will be a great support to him – both as a cousin and as someone who has been there all his life and understands the institution," <strong>HELLO!</strong>'s Royal Editor, Emily Nash, said.&nbsp;</p><p id=eY3-A7o2Ff0 data-wc=23>"Like the rest of the family, I'm sure Peter is lending his support to William and Kate as they face her cancer treatment."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/6d5f96c66abb-zara-peter-fire-engine.jpg><p id=eAT5OPgs-Q1 data-wc=42>Emily noted: "Peter was the eldest of his generation and has naturally taken on a protective role. <strong>He is uniquely placed in that he understands how the royal family and the institution works, but he doesn't have the titles and responsibilities himself.</strong></p><p id=eZwjIc60TLuS data-wc=20>"He has a pragmatic, common sense approach to things and can be <strong>a trusted sounding board for the future King</strong>."</p><h2><strong>His admiration and respect for William and Kate</strong></h2><p id=eyZOH7D_Hhez data-wc=35>Princess Anne's son clearly has admiration for the Waleses. In an interview earlier this year with , he said of Kate: "She's remarkable in herself… <a class=hm-link href=# rel=noopener>Her and William make a fantastic team</a> together."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/e29cabeb7389-peter-phillips-kate-polo.jpg><p id=eNZDiwN0wOY_ data-wc=65>Peter also went on to say that the couple had struck the right balance: "Their kids are great and they have the balance of public life and trying to be parents to three young children, which is always difficult. They've got it pretty right because I think, as history has taught us and anyone knows, that actually you want to be there for your children."</p><h2><strong>Growing up with cousin William</strong></h2><p id=ej19b_Scr8ck data-wc=37>A constant throughout William's life, Peter has always been there for his younger cousin. As children, there was "quite a gang of us growing up", he previously told Ben Shephard and Kate Garraway on .</p><p id=ecjKKG8CI97R data-wc=26>"It was a lot of fun," Peter said.

He accompanied the brothers hiking in the fresh air in the expansive Scottish estate.&nbsp;</p><p id=eqgP0B3tQ_CL data-wc=33>Much was also made of Peter's position in the line of procession at Prince Philip's funeral, when <a class=hm-link href=# rel=noopener>he stood in between the estranged brothers</a> behind their grandfather's coffin, almost acting like a peacekeeper.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/d9531d3acfe9-gettyimages-1232359917.jpg><p id=eUO9gWByjX6A data-wc=37>Peter is said to have been the favourite grandson of the late Duke of Edinburgh, who nicknamed him "the winner" for his sense of easiness, his dependability, his politeness, and his ability to remain calm and collected.&nbsp;</p><p id=eY8UgmRN7u0E data-wc=32>He was the first of the late Queen and Prince Philip's grandchildren to marry, and the first to give the couple a great-grandchild with the birth of his daughter Savannah in 2010.</p><p id=e6YZhdrm0osr data-wc=28>Sadly, he also followed in the footsteps of his mother Princess Anne and his uncles King Charles and Prince Andrew as the first of his generation to divorce.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/bb85aab165f6-peter-phillips-queen.jpg><h2><strong>His split from Lindsay Steven</strong></h2><p id=eD56ek9fBDPm data-wc=37>Earlier this month, a source confirmed to <strong>HELLO!&nbsp;</strong>that <a class=hm-link href=# rel=noopener>Peter and his girlfriend Lindsay had split</a> after four years together. A friend of the couple said they were "spending less time together with work and family commitments".</p><p id=ej8LSJqXywfg data-wc=18>The source said: "Peter's business commitments and work in F1 meant he has been away and travelling non-stop.</p><p id=eKRR6iWcmpl2 data-wc=48>"It obviously came as a shock as most people thought they were absolutely rock solid, it's very sad. Peter has been travelling all over the world and has been incredibly busy and Lindsay is based up in Scotland, so it's been hard for them to see each other."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/a1b91d44732a-peter-phillips-and-lindsay-wallace-at-the-royal-ascot.jpg><p id=eIguFyRlnBfi data-wc=50>His roles as head of partner acquisition for the rights agency CSM Sport & Entertainment and as an <a class=hm-link href=#>ambassador for ISPS Handa</a> have seen him travelling all over the world in recent months.

They lived together in 2001 in North London for around eight months, with the daughter of the Massachusetts cod liver oil tycoon reportedly saying their split "was a question of immaturity".&nbsp;</p><p><b><i>LISTEN: What Scoop's Sam McAlister really told Prince Andrew that convinced him to do Newsnight interview</i></b></p><p id=eYjSLSSqKArr data-wc=34>Not long after, Peter, aged 25 at the time, began a relationship with British Airways air stewardess Tara Swain, 29. It wasn't a match, however, with the couple separating after just four months together.&nbsp;</p><p id=exsV24HAKDus data-wc=39>It was on a business trip at the 2003 Montreal Grand Prix that he met Autumn, who was working as a Budweiser promo girl.
