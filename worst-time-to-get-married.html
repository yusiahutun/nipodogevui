Here, she lays out&nbsp;the pros and cons of tying the knot during peak holiday weekends.</p><p><strong>MORE:<a href=#> 28 Photos That Will Make You Want a Winter Wedding</a></strong></p><p><strong>The problem: Travel is a nightmare.</strong><br>Trying to time a wedding to a holiday for which&nbsp;most Americans will be traveling—whether that’s Christmas, Thanksgiving, or Labor Day—spells disaster for guests. “Everything costs more. Hotels are more expensive; flights are more expensive,” says Khalil. And it’s a cost that’ll probably affect the bride and groom, too.&nbsp;“Vendors see a lot of holidays as a peak day, so they don’t charge less,” says Khalil. She recommends planning up to a year and a half in advance for a holiday wedding so you can avoid some serious price gouging.</p><p><strong>The problem: Your guests might already have plans.</strong><br>You have to be aware that you may be&nbsp;disrupting your guests’ other holiday weekend plans. Maybe they usually go on a cruise over New Year’s or attend&nbsp;an annual Memorial Day BBQ that’s the highlight of their summer. That’s doesn’t mean&nbsp;they wouldn’t be happy to celebrate, but it’s something to consider.</p><p>Time is of the essence in cases like these, Khalil says, who suggests sending out save the dates a year in advance if you can swing it. Make sure to book hotel blocks as soon as possible to snag any early-bird deals. You&nbsp;typically want to work a few months ahead of what you would for&nbsp;a non-holiday weekend.</p><p>Plus, there’s always the option of turning your big day into a party that’s just too good to pass up. Want to&nbsp;get married on&nbsp;New Year’s Eve? Send a tiny bottle of champagne for a Save the Date. Then pick a killer location that begs for a black tie wedding, and voilà! Instant New Year’s Eve plans for you and your friends that are way better than paying a ridiculous cover charge at a bar.</p><p><strong>MORE:<a href=#> Why I Went Engagement Ring Shopping with My Boyfriend</a></strong></p><p><strong>The problem: Guests still can’t make it.</strong><br>Even if you got the message out early and stayed local, odds are there are a lot of people who won’t be able to make your Christmas/Labor Day/Thanksgiving/4th of July wedding. But, as a bride, Khalil says, “you have to anticipate that some people just can’t come.”</p><p>All you can do then is say, “I totally understand; I appreciate your letting me know, and we’ll be sorry to miss you.” If you’re hoping for a huge turnout, the solution is pretty simple: Pick another weekend where more guests are likely able to come.<br>One sneaky silver lining to holiday <a href=# id=auto-tag_weddings data-tag=weddings>weddings</a> is that the guest list will often whittle itself down because of guests’ prior commitments—without any great rifts in family dynamics. “This is a great way to create a more intimate experience without burning bridges,” she says.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57y6Kdnqukrrmme9aem52hnpzAcIGPbWhvbF%2BsvLO%2F02aroqWVYsGwecaeq2alkae%2FqrHDaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./meet-celebrity-contributor-renee-olstead-secret-life-american-teenager.html><span>←</span><span>Renee Olstead From Secret Life Of The American Teenager</span></a>
