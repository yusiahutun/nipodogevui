With the 2020 release of Bill and Ted Face the Music, the John Wick star returns to one of his most famous roles. And, of course, he’ll return as Neo in 2022’s <a href=#>The Matrix 4</a>. But when he does, will on-screen mentor Laurence Fishburne plug back in too?</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/The-Matrix-Reloaded.jpg><h2>Morpheus is the only 1 of the three main heroes to survive the trilogy</h2><p id=par-2_58>Written and directed by The Wachowskis, The Matrix became a cinematic milestone upon its release in 1999. The movie’s visual effects, cornucopia of inspirations, and slick, modern aesthetic made it among the most influential movies of the past couple of decades. So, of course, Warner Bros. gave the Wachowskis’ the chance to expand their vision into a trilogy.</p><p id=par-3_59>Alas, The Matrix Reloaded and The Matrix Revolutions — both released in 2003 — weren’t nearly as well-received. But the sequels arguably provided a sense of closure for the franchise. Both Neo and Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss) died in the third film, leaving Laurence Fishburne the only original cast member to survive the trilogy. Even Hugo Weaving’s Smith was destroyed.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-2><p></p></figure><h2>Now Laurence Fishburne confirms if he will return for ‘The Matrix 4’</h2><p id=par-4_62>As Neo famously said at the end of the first movie, The Matrix series is “a world where anything is possible.” Reeves and Moss are confirmed to return for the upcoming fourth movie. But Fishburne has not commented one way or another whether he would return as Morpheus. The character was pivotal to the trilogy. So certainly, he’d reprise the role, right?</p><p id=par-5_62>Unfortunately, fans hoping to see the three original Matrix heroes reunite are out of luck. In an interview with New York Magazine (via<a href=#> Syfy Wire</a>), Fishburne revealed not only does he not have a role in The Matrix 4. Apparently, he wasn’t invited back. With <a href=#>the absence of Weaving</a> and now Fishburne, the movie will have a lot to make up for.</p><p id=par-6_57>Of course, if the new movie kickstarts a new trilogy, Fishburne could perhaps return later on. In The Matrix Online video game, Morpheus is eventually presumed dead. But even in that case, his status remains ambiguous. Some rumors have also centered on a younger version of Morpheus appearing in the franchise. But that’s all speculation so far.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-3><p></p></figure><h2>Fishburne will still likely reunite with Keanu Reeves on the big screen</h2><p id=par-7_48>Even though Fishburne will not join Reeves back in The Matrix, the pair have another franchise in common. Fishburne joined the John Wick series in 2017’s John Wick: Chapter 2 as the Bowery King. And the actor reprised that role for 2019’s John Wick: Chapter 3 — Parabellum.</p><p id=par-8_52>And based on how the latter movie ends, fans of the John Wick series can probably count on an even more integral role for Fishburne going forward. News recently broke that Reeves has signed on for <a href=#>two more John Wick movies</a>. Here’s hoping that means fans get a lot more Fishburne too.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGTEqrjLZqSoqqCdsra%2FjKucra2io3qnu9Fmq6GdXaKutb7IsWRtZZyWwrOxzZycZp6ZqLWjwdGnnGaemaOurbjYZpinq6eav7R506GcZqmlmsC1tc6nZJ%2BZnqh6qa3VnmSwmZ6psqV506hkpKafrHupwMylZg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./parris-bell.html><span>←</span><span>Who is Parris Bell dating?
