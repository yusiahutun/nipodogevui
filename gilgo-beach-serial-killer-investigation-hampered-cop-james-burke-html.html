It was a real eye-opener,' said Ray.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Before Burke became Suffolk County's top cop, he had been involved in a series of scandals involving prostitutes and drugs, including a tryst in his police car with one of them. An internal police investigation found that Burke left at least one of the women in his patrol car alone with his service weapon resting on the back seat.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Burke had a longstanding relationship with at least two sex workers, according to Ray. He met Lowrita Rickenbacker while patrolling the infamous Albany Ave in Wyandanch.&nbsp;The other was Heather Malone, who ran a prostitution ring out of her hair salon in St. James, going back to the early 1990s.</p><img id=i-6fc3b31f36b5113c src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2023/07/19/15/57890489-12311615-A_photo_of_the_dense_marsh_that_surrounds_Gilgo_Beach_located_ne-a-14_1689776529357.jpg height=356 width=634 alt="The dense marsh that surrounds Gilgo Beach where the bodies were found" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>The dense marsh that surrounds Gilgo Beach where the bodies were found</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>DailyMail.com has attempted to contact both Rickenbacker and Malone.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Rickenbacker had a rap sheet totaling 42 felonies and misdemeanors.

She told him that the pair would often have trysts at his home in Ronkonkoma, smoke crack together and he'd indulge in his fetish for cross dressing.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>An anonymous source also told DailyMail.com that Rickenbacker became pregnant during one of these trysts, and they now have an adult child together.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Burke's other lover, Malone, would often accompany Burke on work events.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Ray first learned about Malone when he met Guy Malone, the jilted spouse.

Guy had accused his ex of adultery.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Ryan said Heather Malone would carry a beeper around so the pair could communicate. Those calls were eventually traced back to Burke. It is unclear if the pair are still in touch, but Ray told DailyMail.com that she was never charged for any wrongdoing.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Ray alleged that on two occasions Burke was seen dressed in women's clothing - specifically women's under garments during a sex romp at a hotel in Wading River with a sex worker from Oregon. He was spotted again in women's clothing when a private investigator that Ray works with saw him driving in his car. When he got wind that the investigator was trailing him he reportedly hit the gas.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'Here is the chief of police ...
