"I used to be a dancer so my body remembers its muscle tone, it comes back pretty quickly if I do some stretches and some of the basic bar moves that I used to do when I was a ballet dancer."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/c9e1e4bc09f7-jane-for-story-2.jpg><h2><strong>What does Jane Seymour eat?</strong></h2><p id=eMkQNy9kuhU data-wc=27>Jane Seymour's healthy diet is likely responsible for her gorgeous figure, with the siren eating a Mediterranean diet and fasting to maintain her toned physique.</p><p id=ejFOgh84VGC data-wc=68>"I do intermittent fasting, unless I have to work very early in the morning on a film and I feel I need the extra energy. I generally give my body 16 hours minimum to recoup. I think it works brilliantly. I've seen it work for me but I'm not religious about it. If I'm going out for a glorious dinner, everything gets thrown out the window," she says.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/1cabe582efcf-jane-t-image.jpg><p id=eVl83GfNxu- data-wc=38>Jane's approach to ageing is inspiring, too. "The world is against ageing. We hate ageing. We look at ageing and we go, 'Oh, no, there's a wrinkle, oh my God. Get rid of it. Grey hair. No. Terrifying!'</p><p id=eKZPTd2Enln data-wc=40>"Whereas you can look at it the other way and you can say actually, 'I now have time in my life to do things I really want to do.

That's why I don't do the things a lot of people are doing because I'm a blank canvas. I'm an actress.
