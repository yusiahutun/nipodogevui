Although <a href=# id=auto-tag_retinol data-tag=retinol>retinol</a> is touted by many as one of the best anti-aging ingredients, it can be quite tricky to get right. You might think you’re missing out on retinol’s benefits, but guess what? There’s an <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">alternative</a> that might just be the perfect fit for your skin.&nbsp;</p><p>We spoke with double board-certified dermatologist, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Dr. Brendan Camp</a> of MDCS Dermatology, about <a href=# id=auto-tag_bakuchiol data-tag=bakuchiol>bakuchiol</a> versus retinol and which one might agree with your skin more. On top of providing all of the need-to-know info about the two ingredients, Dr. Camp also shares his top product picks for each one.</p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Outlander.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Outlander.jpg><p>If you’re eager to make a decision between bakuchiol and retinol, keep reading for a breakdown of the ingredients and recommended products.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=what-is-bakuchiol>What is bakuchiol?</h2><p>“<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Bakuchiol</a> is a vegan skincare ingredient found in the leaves and seeds of the Psoralea corylifolia plant, which is used in Indian and Chinese traditional medicine,” according to Dr. Camp. And what exactly does it do for the skin? It boasts “promising anti-aging, anti-inflammatory, and antibacterial properties,” per this <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">study</a>, which found a “reduction in photodamage, hyperpigmentation, wrinkle scores, and acne severity.” Similar to retinol, bakuchiol is a do-it-all skincare ingredient that belongs in your regular rotation.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=what-is-retinol>What is retinol?</h2><p>To understand what bakuchiol does, it’s important to dive into <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">retinol</a>, as well. According to our derm expert, “Retinol is a milder form of tretinoin (a retinoid) and is available over-the-counter, where it is primarily marketed as an anti-aging product to help address wrinkles, dark spots, and collagen production.” With capabilities like that, no wonder derms, celebs and TikTokers swear by retinol products.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=what-are-the-potential-side-effects-of-bakuchiol>What are the potential side effects of bakuchiol?</h2><p>Unlike retinol, bakuchiol does not get a bad rap for potential side effects. However, Dr. Camp mentions that it can’t hurt to do a spot test to see if bakuchiol leads to any irritation. He also notes that “It is recommended that patients wait to use bakuchiol while pregnant or breastfeeding until more data is published.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=what-are-the-potential-side-effects-of-retinol><strong>What are the potential side effects of retinol?</strong></h2><p>Like I said before, retinol is tricky, and it might not always play well with your skin. You might even experience retinoid dermatitis, which “can occur from using too much of the product or using it too frequently, and presents with redness, dryness, itching, and flaking,” our expert adds. If any of these retinol side effects ring a bell, it might be time to switch over to using bakuchiol instead.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=how-often-should-you-apply-bakuchiol><strong>How often should you apply bakuchiol?</strong></h2><p>According to Dr. Camp, you can apply products with bakuchiol on a daily basis.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=how-often-should-you-apply-retinol><strong>How often should you apply retinol?</strong></h2><p>Retinols, however, are a whole different story. Slow and steady wins the race when it comes to this ingredient. Our derm expert suggests starting your retinol journey by applying it once every third night for one month. You can progress to every other night for one month and then nightly if your skin can tolerate it.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=which-ingredients-work-best-with-bakuchiol><strong>Which ingredients work best with bakuchiol?</strong></h2><p>Dr. Camp recommends using hydrating skincare formulas alongside bakuchiol. This includes <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">ceramides</a> and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">hyaluronic acid</a>, among others.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=which-ingredients-do-not-work-well-with-bakuchiol><strong>Which ingredients do not work well with bakuchiol?</strong></h2><p>“It has been reported that <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">glycolic acid</a> might degrade bakuchiol. Ingredients that can be potentially irritating, such as <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">benzoyl peroxide</a>, are best used alone,” our derm expert explains.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=which-ingredients-work-best-with-retinol><strong>Which ingredients work best with retinol?&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>Reach for products with ingredients that offer moisture and strengthen your skin’s natural barrier. Just like with bakuchiol, ceramides and hyaluronic acid will do the trick. “It is important to use sun protection in the form of a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">daily SPF</a> moisturizer when using retinol because it can cause sun sensitivity,” adds Dr. Camp.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=which-ingredients-do-not-work-well-with-retinol><strong>Which ingredients do not work well with retinol?</strong></h2><p>Steer clear of benzoyl peroxide, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">alpha-hydroxy acids and beta-hydroxy acids</a> while using retinol, since these ingredients can further aggravate your skin.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=how-do-you-know-which-ingredient-to-choose-for-your-skin><strong>How do you know which ingredient to choose for your skin?&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>Let’s make it clear, bakuchiol is certainly an effective (and vegan) <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">retinol alternative</a>, and both ingredients help tackle visible signs of aging. “If you have particularly sensitive skin or have skin prone to rosacea or eczema, it may be safer to start with bakuchiol,” says Dr. Camp. However, “If your skin is generally tolerant of new skincare ingredients, there is a lot of scientific evidence to support the use of retinol,” he adds.</p><p>Now that you’ve learned all there is to know about bakuchiol and retinol, it’s time for the fun part: shopping!
