For some, it’s their partner, and for others, well, as they say: a pet can be (wom)man’s best friend.&nbsp;</p><p>So, is your pooch your priority? <a href=#>Your cat</a> the greatest creature that ever lived? Here are seven signs that you love your pet more than your partner.</p><p class=inline-stn-player></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Greetings</h2><p>You arrive home and are greeted by your pet and your partner; and you greet them in that order. Sure, your partner may have prepared you a delicious meal and come to open the door in person, but how could you possibly resist giving your pet a quick pat first.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Massage Priority</h2><p>A tummy rub for your pooch can last the length of a movie or at least until they decide otherwise. A <a href=#>shoulder rub</a> for your partner, on the other hand, is lucky to last two minutes. On the plus side, at least your partner can reciprocate!</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Dinner Time</h2><p>You direct the question, “What do you feel like for dinner?” to your furry companion as you stand in front of&nbsp;a cabinet full of options both wet and dry&nbsp;to spoil your pet with – you end up choosing the same one you chose yesterday, which is inevitably their favorite.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Treats</h2><p>You return from grocery shopping with a basket of treats for your pet and forget the one thing your partner asked for.

Your reaction is to turn to your pooch and gush, “That’s because she’s such a good girl, aren’t you? Yes, you are!”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Your Favorite Couch Cuddler</h2><p>When your pooch jumps up on the couch he/she is greeted with a pat. Before your partner has the chance to sit on the couch they’re greeted with, “Are those pants clean?”</p><p>This article originally appeared on our sister site, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Homes to Love.</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7p7XRrKufp6KsvK6xzWeaqKVfpby0wNJop56so2SxsHnYqKxmpJ%2Brsm7Fzq6pZqiVqXquu9GeZK2gkaN6urvUq2SpmaKpu6a%2B</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./how-to-make-tea-infused-oatmeal.html><span>←</span><span>Make Tea-Infused Oatmeal for a Tasty Breakfast</span></a>
