<span>Aldo Pusey</span></p><h1>Gigi Santo Pietro: All We Know About Vanna White's Daughter</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>Gigi Santo Pietro is a tattoo artist at Lincoln Tattoo Company in LA. However, she is famous as the only daughter of American actress and TV host Vanna White. Despite being a renowned TV personality, holding her role as the beloved co-host of the famous TV show “Wheel of Fortune” since 1982, Gigi’s mother speaks fondly of her role as a mother. In an interview, she described being a mom as her “favorite job.”&nbsp;</p><p>Although Gigi is one of White’s two children with her ex-husband, George Santo Pietro, she keeps her daughter out of the media’s prying eyes. However, having such a celebrated TV personality as a mother, Gigi has leveraged her mother’s fame to make a name for herself as a tattoo artist.&nbsp;</p><p>While she didn’t follow in her mother’s footsteps, many are curious about her early life, relationship, and whether she will ever grace the screens. Here’s what we know.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/photo_2023-10-05_06-50-04-fotor-2023100565321.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Who_Is_Vanna_Whites_Daughter></span>Who Is Vanna White’s Daughter?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Vanna White’s daughter was born Giovanna Santo Pietro in Los Angeles, California, USA, on July 2, 1997. Hence, she is 26 years old. Gigi Santo Pietro is an American citizen with White Caucasian ethnic roots.</p><p>While her father, George, is a restaurant owner, her mother is a famous actress and TV personality. Growing up, Gigi lived with her parents and siblings in Los Angeles and attended the Baptist church with her mother.</p><p>Due to White’s love for keeping her children out of the limelight, most details about Gigi’s early life elude the media. However, the celebrity kid had her high school education at The Buckley School in Sherman Oaks, California. After graduating high school, Gigi studied photography at New York University, graduating in 2019 with a Bachelor’s degree of Arts in Photography and Imaging.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/photo_2023-10-05_06-49-40-fotor-2023100565654.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=What_Does_Vanna_Whites_Daughter_Do></span>What Does Vanna White’s Daughter Do?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Gigi became interested in arts and photography while growing up with her famous mother. Consequently, after graduating from the University, Gigi Santo Pietro pursued photography.&nbsp;</p><p>Her digital resume showcases a host of her creative experiences, including shooting senior portraits at her alma mater, taking headshots for actors, working as an assistant photographer for a cover shoot for Redbook magazine, taking photos for a model’s portfolio and photographing an event for a music blog.&nbsp;</p><p>In addition, she’s also provided red-carpet coverage for several events and had her photography displayed at the Armory Center. However, Gigi Santo Pietro works as a tattoo artist at Lincoln Tattoo Company in Lincoln Boulevard, California. Despite her mother’s fame, Gigi made a name for herself through hard work and recorded a successful career as a tattoo artist.&nbsp;</p><p>In an <a href=#>Instagram</a> post, Vanna White’s daughter opened up about her passion for her job. She wrote, “It’s love that keeps me going. I LOVE what I do. It keeps me up at night. I work hard towards my craft to give you the best tattoo,” Gigi wrote in the caption alongside two snaps of her working on a sketch with her tattoo machine. Even though Gigi forged her path, she maintains a close relationship with her mom, who is proud of her.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Who_Is_Gigi_Santo_Pietros_Father></span>Who Is Gigi Santo Pietro’s Father?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Gigi Santo Pietro’s father, George Santo Pietro, is a restaurateur, real estate developer, and former Hollywood producer. Some of his movie and TV show production credits include “Two and a Half Men,” “Think Like a Man,” “The Good Place,” “The Big Bang Theory,” “True Blood,” “Buffy the Vampire Slayers,” and “LA Doctors,” among others.</p><p>However, his success in the entertainment industry did not hinder him from pursuing other ventures. George Santo launched a popular restaurant, Santo Pietro’s, in Bel-Air, California, in a secluded Hollywood strip mall close to Mulholland Drive. George’s restaurant reportedly had a clientele of Hollywood celebrities and was famous for its fine cuisine.&nbsp;</p><p>Afterward, George opened another restaurant majoring in Sushi, Sushi-ko. Like his first restaurant, Sushi-ko became a success and hosted exclusive customers. However, Gigi’s father delved into real estate recently and has made a tremendous fortune from his business ventures.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/photo_2023-10-05_06-49-50-fotor-2023100565555.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Are_Gigi_Santo_Pietros_Parents_Together></span>Are Gigi Santo Pietro’s Parents Together?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>No, they are not. Gigi Santo Pietro’s parents met for the first time in 1985 in Studio City. According to reports, <a href=#>Vanna White’s</a> friends dragged her out for a dinner date with George, and they clicked at the first meeting. As a result, the lovebirds started dating and remained in a relationship for the next five years. However, they took their relationship further when they exchanged marital vows in December 1990.&nbsp;</p><p>Two years into their marriage, White suffered a miscarriage, and George supported her through the trying times. Fortunately, the then-couple welcomed their first child, Nikko, four years later, and seven years later, Gigi joined the family. Although the couple enjoyed several happy moments with their kids, it all ended twelve years later.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Vanna White and George Pietro filed for divorce in 2002 after 12 years of marriage, citing irreconcilable differences. However, for the sake of their children, the ex-couple kept their relationship civil and finalized their divorce without any form of drama. Consequently, Gigi and her brother, Nikko, split their time between their parents and still had a normal childhood.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/photo_2023-10-05_06-49-45-fotor-2023100565617.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Who_Is_Gigi_Santo_Pietro_Dating></span>Who Is Gigi Santo Pietro Dating?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Despite being a celebrity kid, Gigi is very private about her life. Hence, there are no details regarding who she is dating. Although rumors suggest she is in a relationship, no evidence supports the claims. Like Marc Anthony’s daughter, <a href=#>Ariana Anthony</a>, Gigi Santo Pietro is single and has no child.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifmajBp7HSrWWcp51ktKqzyGaqmqakpHqxtcStqahlkaG5bsPEZqKnp6dirqO71K1kr5meo65uw8eiq56rXZmutrPHrZyrZw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./439123-100-happy-sunday-quotes-facebook-uplift-you.html><span>←</span><span>100+ happy Sunday quotes for Facebook that will uplift you</span></a>
