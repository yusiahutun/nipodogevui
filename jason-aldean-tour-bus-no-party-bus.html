He's replaced the liquor bottles with baby bottles, and there's much less partying going on overall thanks to his infant son, Memphis.</p><p>“Used to, when you walked on our bus there was liquor bottles," Aldean tells <a href=#>Entertainment Tonight</a> in a recent interview. "Now, there’s like baby bottles and empty formula cans and toys all on the floor. It’s crazy.”</p><p>The singer is about to welcome even more bottles and diapers with the addition of his fourth child, a girl, arriving later this year. This marks Aldean's second child with wife Brittany. He has two older daughters, Keeley and Kendyl, from a previous marriage.</p><p>The singer has been getting used to his new reality since Memphis was born last December. As he describes his tour now: “It’s got two cribs in the bus, which I never in the early days of my touring career thought I’d ever do that, but it’s different,” he previously told&nbsp;<a href=#>People</a>. “It’s a lot different now than it was the early part of my career. Things are settled down.”</p><p>“I got playpens sitting outside my bus on college football. I’m watching college football and [son Memphis] is in the playpen. That was never a thing early on, so it’s cool,” he adds.</p><p>Aldean told&nbsp;<a href=#>Taste of Country Nights</a>&nbsp;back in May that he <a href=#>appreciates </a>being able to take his little boy out on the road with him, something that wasn't possible when his two older children were younger.</p><p>"Back when [my daughters] were born, when I was touring I was on one bus with my whole band—there was 12 of us on a bus," he explained. "So I wasn’t in a position to be able to carry them out a whole lot back then."</p><p><strong>Love Jason Aldean?
