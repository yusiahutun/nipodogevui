While the Terms of Service don't necessarily permit this, we know it happens all the time.</p><p>However, what happens, when your account is used without your permission? Maybe someone shared your credentials with someone else, or someone managed to hack your account. Whatever the reason, there's a way to figure out if someone is using your HBO Max Account and stop them immediately.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><h2 id=how-to-tell-if-someone-rsquo-s-using-your-hbo-max-account>How to Tell if Someone’s Using Your HBO Max Account</h2><p>When too many people are using your account, you won't be allowed to start a new stream. Up to three <a href=#>people can watch HBO Max at once</a>, which should be more than enough for a regular household. With that said, you can <a href=#>create and manage several profiles on your HBO Max account</a>.</p><p>If you want to check who exactly is using your HBO Max account, here is what you have to do on your computer:</p><li>Go to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">hbomax.com</a>, log into your account and choose one of the profiles. You will not be able to access the account settings via the kid profiles.</li><li>Click your profile picture in the right-top corner and go to <strong>Manage Devices.</strong></li><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/HBO-Manage-devices.JPG><p>Here's how you can check who's using your account via the HBO Max mobile app:</p><li>Launch the HBO Max app on your device.</li><li>Choose your profile and tap on the profile image in the bottom right corner.</li><li>Then go to the <strong>Settings </strong>cog and to<strong> Manage Devices.</strong></li><p>You'll see a list of devices used to access your HBO Max account on both platforms. This tells you the type of device that was used—smart TV, mobile app, or browse—so you can see if a device you don't know is using your account. It will also tell you when that device was last used, with the most recently used device at the top of the list.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><h2 id=how-to-stop-someone-from-using-your-hbo-max-account>How to Stop Someone From Using Your HBO Max Account</h2><p>If any of the devices that show up on your screen aren't yours or belong to someone you haven't shared your account with, you can remove them from your list.</p><p>In order to remove a device from your account, you need to follow all the above-mentioned steps to reach the device manager. From there, you simply have to click on the <strong>X button</strong> near the name of the device to get rid of it.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/HBO-Max-Manage-devices-on-mobile.jpg><p>Alternatively, you can also click <strong>Sign All Devices Out</strong> in order to cut the connection with all computers and TVs. Anyone who wants to use the app will have to log in again.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><h2 id=how-to-stop-people-from-accessing-your-hbo-max-account>How to Stop People From Accessing Your HBO Max Account</h2><p>If you removed a device from your HBO Max account or signed out all devices, we suggest you change your password. That way, it'll be harder to access your account without your permission.</p><p>Here's how you can change your password:</p><li>Go to HBO Max and log into your account. Click on your profile picture to reveal the menu.</li><li>Click on <strong>Account.</strong></li><li>Click the <strong>edit button</strong> located on the right side of your password.</li><li>A unique 6-digit code will be delivered to your email address. Copy that code and type it in the field.</li><li>Next, create a new password, confirm it, and you're good to go.</li><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>Changing your password is an essential step if you're going to sign out all other devices from your account. Otherwise, whoever was hogging your HBO Max account can just use the same credentials to log back in, which isn't something you want them to do.</p><h2 id=account-safety-made-easy>Account Safety Made Easy</h2><p>Being able to see who is using your HBO Max account is a way to manage your account and keep it safe at the same time. Such an easy way to remove unwanted connections is great, especially since account theft happens frequently.</p><p>Even if you willingly shared your account with someone else, it's important to have the power to put a stop to this anytime you want, whether it's on HBO Max, Netflix, or another subscription service you use.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rq3KnqysnZ%2Bbe6S7zGiip6enYranedKopJ6nnpp6tr%2FErGShmp9iuqLEjJqanKelo8Fuv9Oop2asmJq6cA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./5-best-breakfast-dishes-yangon-myanmar-vivid-southeast.html><span>←</span><span>5 of the best breakfast dishes in Yangon, Myanmar the vivid Southeast Asian city with great stre</span></a>
