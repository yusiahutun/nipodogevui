<span>Larita Shotwell</span></p><h1>A high-pitched whining noise. Chris Coyier</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>September 28, 2022</p><p>That‚Äôs what our new Tesla sounds like. They finally‚Ä¶ gave in, I‚Äôd call it‚Ä¶ and gave us our Tesla last Friday. <a href=#>It‚Äôs been delay after delay</a>. The actual problem as it turns out is that it emits a tone, to put it mildly. I didn‚Äôt notice it at first in the car lot with the typical road noise nearby. But now that we‚Äôve had it a little while, it‚Äôs pretty darn noticeable. Parked in a quiet garage, if you didn‚Äôt know it was our car, you‚Äôd be like what the hell is that noise? It makes the high-pitched whining noise at all times when the car is ‚Äúon‚Äù (a bit of an amorphous concept with a Tesla) but does sometimes stop when the car becomes ‚Äúoff‚Äù.</p><p>The delays were because they wanted to fix it. Which is nice of course, it was just the lack of communication about exactly what was going on and what they were trying to do which was annoying.</p><p>Apparently, the solution is entirely software (firmware?). They told us about 4 Tesla software updates from now, the problem will be solved. The duder showed us the exact software number but I forgot to write it down and they didn‚Äôt make any effort to document it and send it to us. He was also very cagey about how long it would take. Probably not a year. Six months? Hopefully not, but maybe. There have already been 2 updates since Friday so maybe a lot sooner.</p><p>Apparently, this is happening to a good number of model X versions. And, get this, it apparently started with ours. As they noticed the noise and were trying to get to the bottom of it, apparently engineering was pretty confounded by the issue. Ultimately it turned into some kind of internal blog post that went out to Tesla engineers which began with our car. I‚Äôd love to see that.</p><p>Anyway now we have a very expensive car that squeals at us and no absolute guarantee it will stop. Fingers crossed.</p><p>It‚Äôs still a pretty damn cool car. Here are some terrible photos. I‚Äôll have to bust out a proper camera to take some cool pictures of it soon.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/chriscoyier.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/IMG_4177.jpeg><p><h3 class=jp-relatedposts-headline>Related</h3></p><p class=article-end>ü§ò</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmibmKe2tK%2FOsqCeql6jsrV7kWlpa2dgbnxzhI6aZKGhl516sbXTnJ%2BenF2staq6yKeeZqafnsCmew%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./best-tights.html><span>‚Üê</span><span>13 Best Tights, Tested and Reviewed for 2024</span></a>
