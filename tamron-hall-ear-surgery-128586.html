But a pair of earrings ripped my ear and the tear just kept going so I had to have surgery on my ears," Tamron revealed, adding she couldn't wear earrings again for a few months.</p><p>"I went to a guy who's known for body modification art because I heard he's the best ear reconstruction person," she continued. "He's not a medical doctor, but he is famous for what he does. He sewed both of my ears back, I had stitches."</p><p><a href=#>MUST SEE: How Did Chris Kattan Break His Neck?

Tamron did not disclose the price of her procedure when discussing her ordeal on-air.</p><p>The TV star even documented the experience via her Instagram page. "Ouch. Vaca?," Tamron captioned a photo of herself getting her earlobes repaired.</p><p>Interestingly, a few of Tamron's 280K Instagram followers commented that they too had ripped their earlobes because of large earrings! "I had the same thing happen to me from wearing big gold earrings in the late 80s — now I just stick with my diamond studs!" one fan wrote with another adding, "OMG that happened to me too!"</p><p><a href=#>MUST SEE: Hugh Jackman Gives Fans Skin Cancer Update: "Everything Is Fine"</a></p><p>In early February, Tamron abruptly exited the Today show —&nbsp; leading many fans to speculate <a href=#><strong>Megyn Kelly</strong>'s addition to the team</a> caused her to leave the program.</p><p>"The last 10 years have been beyond anything I could have imagined, and I’m grateful," Tamron <a href=#>said in a statement released by NBC at the time of her departure</a>. "I’m also very excited about the next chapter. To all my great colleagues, I will miss you and I will be rooting for you."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46tmKaqn6N6qa3LpWSemaJiwLa%2Bxp6psmVhZ4V2hJVo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./kate-middleton-floral-baby-blue-dress.html><span>←</span><span>Kate Middleton's Baby-Blue Dress Is Her Prettiest Summer Look Yet</span></a>
