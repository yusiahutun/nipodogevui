Here's what you can do if your favorites disappear.</p><h2 id=why-do-apps-disappear>Why Do Apps Disappear?</h2><p>Before we talk about how you can get apps that are no longer available to download from your phone's respective app store, let's first talk about why apps get removed in the first place.</p><p>Generally, this is a call by the developer; the app gets pulled because they no longer support it. Case in point: Epic Games <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">once pulled all versions of Infinity Blade from the iOS App Store</a> for that exact reason. The company claimed a lack of resources to support the games "at a level that meets [their] current standards." Makes sense —if you're going to do something, might as well do it right, after all.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>More often than not, this is how it goes. The app becomes more trouble than it's worth to continue supporting, its features get moved into another app from the same developer (and there's no need for redundancy), or the developer is dissolved completely.</p><p>The good news is that if the app you're looking for isn't available for any of those reasons, you should still be able to re-download it if you've previously had it downloaded (this is especially true for paid apps).</p><p>That said, it's worth noting that if the app is removed by the app store owner itself —Apple in the case of the iOS App Store or Google for the Play Store —then it's most likely gone forever. If they pulled it, there's a good reason for that, so you can't expect to get it back easily.</p><p>If the app is no longer in the app store, however, here's the easiest way to get it back for both Android or iOS devices.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=how-to-download-apps-that-are-no-longer-in-the-ios-app-store>How to Download Apps That Are No Longer in the iOS App Store</h2><p>If you're an iOS user, your options are pretty limited —you have to get your apps from the App Store. Fortunately, if you bought or downloaded an app that is no longer available, you can probably still grab it.</p><p>First, fire up the App Store, then tap on the account icon in the top right corner.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/img_0388.PNG><p>From there, tap on "Purchased" (the App Store counts any download, even free, as a "purchase").</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/img_0389.PNG> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>To see all the apps that aren't already on your phone or iPad (which is the likely scenario if you're trying to pull something that's no longer in the App Store), tap on "Not on this iPhone/iPad."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/img_0390.PNG><p>From there, you can scroll through the list to find the app you want to install, then tap the little cloud icon to download it. Easy peasy.</p><h2 id=how-to-download-apps-that-are-no-longer-in-google-play>How to Download Apps That Are No Longer in Google Play</h2><p>While you only have one option to download deprecated apps on iOS, there are a couple of ways to do this on Android: get it from the Google Play Store or download the APK and sideload the app. While the former is the most straightforward way, the latter offers a way to install apps that have been removed from Google Play completely.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h3 id=how-to-install-removed-apps-from-google-play>How to Install Removed Apps from Google Play</h3><p>First, open the Play Store, then tap your profile icon and select "Manage Apps & Device" from the menu.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/screenshot_2023-12-04-12-45-04-35_b5a5c5cb02ca09c784c5d88160e2ec24.jpg><p>Switch over to the "Manage" tab and tap the "Installed" drop-down menu.

It's not a complicated process, but how you do it will depend on which version of Android your phone is running.</p><p>If you have sideloaded apps before and just need a good place to find something that is no longer in the Play Store, <a href=#>APK Mirror</a> is your answer. It's the best place on the net to grab Android apps to sideload. It's a trustworthy source that only features free apps (there are no pirated apps on APK Mirror), and every app is legitimate. It's also worth mentioning that there are several versions of some apps depending on the model of your phone and the hardware details. Make sure you <a href=#>know which APK is the correct version for your device</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvWraagnZWge6S7zGhqcnBpZ4BwtM6wZK2nXZm8uLrLqJidZZGlvbR506GYrWWRp7Juus5mo6iml5q%2FbrXNZrCoraJivam7zZ6qZpmgpXq0wM6rnGg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./how-to-clean-potatoes.html><span>←</span><span>How to Clean Potatoes in a Dishwasher</span></a>
