Being the comic he is, Druski had no issue making light of his mishap as he became the <a href=#>subject of several funny memes.</a></p><p>“That pussy almost me,” he joked after falling while Juvenile’s “Back That Azz Up” instrumental began playing. “White bitches ain’t shit… Bitch, I almost twisted my ankle… You see what I do for that white pussy? I just twisted my shit. If it ain’t snowing, I ain’t going.”</p><p>Druski then turned his attention to the venue’s security: “Bitch, what the fuck you doing? You ain’t catch me, n-gga!
