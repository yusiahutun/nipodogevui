She was depicted as someone who was difficult to work with, due to her also leaving her previous long-running show, Beverly HIlls 90210, after just four seasons.</p><p>Now, Combs is claiming that Doherty didn't quit due to a feud with Milano, as was reported at the time. Rather, she claims Doherty was fired because Milano gave producers an ultimatum ... her or me.</p><p>Speaking with Doherty on her <a href=#><strong>Let's Be Clear</strong></a> podcast, Combs said she went straight to the source, show producers Jonathan Levin, in the early 2000s to find out the real story behind Doherty's departure.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:75e12b30-260d-4a5a-a244-3a978e47f5a8 data-container-ref=toofab:article:d2c79495-bebb-416b-868f-efd4774745b7 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/a3/5by4/2023/03/20/a33b2cc0e7e843d1a12a1162ac242635_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Nick Cinea, courtesy of Thats4Entertainment / Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Alyssa Milano Fangirls Over Charmed Reunion Without Her at 90s Con</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>"He said, 'We didn't mean to, but we've been backed into this corner. We're basically in this position where it's one or the other,'" said Combs. "'We were told [by Milano] it's her or [Doherty] and Alyssa has threatened to sue us for a hostile workplace environment.'"</p><p>Combs further claimed that Milano had been documenting "every time she felt uncomfortable on set," as if she was building a case against Combs and Doherty. She further said that while there might have been some friction between the ladies, she'd never witnessed anything significant, so it came as a huge surprise.</p><p>In fact, she said no crew or guest stars or anyone really noticed, so far as she knows. "It was all behind the scenes," she said. "There's not a director that wouldn't work with you again. There's not a crew member that didn’t have a great time working with you. So by today's standards, it wouldn't f--king fly."</p><p>Doherty said that she spent that first year after her firing "sort of replaying everything in my brain and really trying to find those moments ... and I couldn't find them. I don't ever remember being mean to her on set."</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:7a2b7e7f-4152-404d-b39b-d3f91fe9f179 data-container-ref=toofab:article:d2c79495-bebb-416b-868f-efd4774745b7 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=28><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/53/5by4/2023/12/06/533df7d4c1a04360bac62c16eabf4599_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Shannen Doherty Says She Underwent Brain Surgery After Discovering Husband's Alleged Infidelity</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>She also said she wishes she'd had a little more years and experience under her belt at the time because she would have rejected her legal advice and sued and been honest. After all, her agreement to say she "quit" didn't stop rumors from following her for years afterward.</p><p>According to the podcast, Doherty was advised against suing for fear it could cost her work. The agreement reached was that she could say she had quit the show without having to admit she wasn't getting paid out, per her contract, and that she'd been given the boot.</p><p>A few months after she departed the show, Doherty told ET, per <a href=#><strong>Us Weekly</strong></a>, "There was too much drama and not enough passion for the work." She said she was too old for the drama, adding, "I'll miss Holly a lot and that's really the only thing I want to clear up." She did not mention Milano.</p><p>As for forgiveness, Doherty said it's more about accepting what happened. "As you get older, you accept that a situation happened. Acceptance and moving on with your life does not equate to forgiveness," she explained. "You just learn a lesson and look at somebody differently and move on."</p><p>Back in 2013, Milano addressed Doherty's departure from the show on Watch What Happens Live, telling <a href=#><strong>Andy Cohen</strong></a>, "I don't know if she got fired; we never really found out what happened," while acknowledging there were "definitely some rough days" on set.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:7f7d39ca-7f28-4f86-b309-16c77050a118 data-container-ref=toofab:article:d2c79495-bebb-416b-868f-efd4774745b7 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/9f/5by4/2023/11/29/9f377298d21b4fa8a12d7e108673afcb_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Shannen Doherty Says She's 'Not Done Living' As Cancer Spreads to Her Bones</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>In 2021, she told ET that she takes "responsibility for a lot" of what happened between her and Doherty, saying much of it was due to her "feeling that I was in a competition rather than it being that sisterhood that the show was so much about. And I have some guilt about my part in that."</p><p>In the previous episode of Doherty's podcast, she said she'd heard about Milano talking about that unexpected "competitiveness" between them in her book, but she had no intention of reading it, "because it's [titled] 'Sorry Not Sorry,' it tells me you're not friggin' sorry. Why even mention something in that case?"</p><p>She also claimed that Milano and her mother had kept her from seeing Combs in the hospital shortly after a surgery; Milano's mother publicly denied that claim, per <a href=#><strong>TMZ</strong></a>, questioning how that would have even been possible.</p><p>When it came down that Doherty was leaving the show, Combs said she wanted to walk away with her longtime friend. "She didn't want to do it without me," Combs recalled saying at the time. "Therefore, I don't want to do it without her and that should be fairly clear."</p><p>Unfortunately, per Combs, Levin threatened to sue her if she quit the show, which she said felt like "blackmail" at the time, and so she stayed as McGowan came on the show. Combs would remain with the show alongside Milano and McGowan until its conclusion after eight seasons.</p><a id=gallery-link-a8342f92-fb93-4096-a978-1b2abf902772 class="media-link gallery-block__link js-track-link js-click-gallery" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:gallery:a8342f92-fb93-4096-a978-1b2abf902772 data-context='{"name":"gallery-block","section":"permalink"}' data-container-ref=toofab:article:d2c79495-bebb-416b-868f-efd4774745b7 data-gallery-layout=carousel><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/bc/4by3/2023/12/16/bcc866074cee42948073e9a8a543ab1b_md.jpg width=825 height=618 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3R7kGtmanBfnbytuNhmpJqqmZp6pLvMm6pmm5yWtq6%2FjJqjsqujlnqutcuapahlpaHBqrnAraymZaOdrq%2B6xKdknaeYmr%2B1xYyfoKudlGKwqa3RppydZw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./erica-mena-1st-pic-daughter-safire-safaree-samuels-split-rumors.html><span>←</span><span>Erica Mena Shares 1st Pic Of Daughter Safire By Safaree Samuels Amid Split Hollywood Life</span></a>
