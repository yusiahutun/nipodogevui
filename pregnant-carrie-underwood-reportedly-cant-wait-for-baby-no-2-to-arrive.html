In fact, the country crooner and her hubby, <a href=#>Mike Fisher</a>, are supposedly “feeling a little stressed about finishing” the nursey room inside their newly built Nashville estate. “Carrie still needs to have someone put up a few shelves and there are a couple of pictures left to hang.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Carrie-Underwood-Mike-Fisher-Son.jpg><p>Carrie and Mike, 38, are already the parents to their <a href=#>3-year-old son, Isaiah</a>.&nbsp;When the blonde beauty first announced she and her hubby are expecting their second child, fans went crazy trying to figure out whether Carrie is expecting a boy or a girl.</p><p>The “Cry Pretty” singer ended up&nbsp;<a href=#>revealing her expectant son’s gender</a> after being begged by <a href=#>Brad Paisley</a> onstage at the <a href=#>CMA Awards</a> on Wednesday, Nov. 14. “Oh, my gosh, Willie, it’s a Willie,” Carrie reluctantly yelled after Brad pestered the star by naming a plethora of male-female country duos like “Johnny or June?

We’re excited!”</p><p>Now that we know the gender, fans are dying to know what names are being considered for their newest baby. “Carrie and Mike are keeping their decision top secret, but I’ve heard they’re sticking with biblical names, so I’m betting on Adam or Andrew,” the source dished to&nbsp;Life & Style.&nbsp;We can’t wait to find out what name they choose!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46pqZ6fnpa7tXnCmqmroZViwq%2BwxKuuqKeUYr%2BmvM6rq56cnK56pK3NrWSwmZmpeqe70WaZmpqpYruweZFmq6hlkae%2FqsLEaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./best-websites-free-whois-information.html><span>←</span><span>The 9 Best Websites to Look Up WHOIS Information for Free</span></a>
