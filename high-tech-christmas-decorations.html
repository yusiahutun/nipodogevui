But this time around, you want to upgrade your holiday decorations and go for high-tech ones that truly elevate the festive vibes.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Well, you’ve come to the right place. Check out this list of the coolest gadgets you can deck your halls with this coming Christmas.</p><h2 id=holographic-santa>1. Holographic Santa</h2><p>Displaying an inflatable Santa Claus on your front lawn is so old school. It’s time for the jolly, good fellow to get an upgrade, and what better way to do that than with a fully animated holographic Santa who looks so real he’ll surely impress guests and anyone passing by.</p><p>This is the sort of high-tech effect you should be looking at this holiday season. All you'll need is a DVD player or a computer, a projector, and a digital projection of Santa from companies like <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">AtmosFX</a> or <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Virtual Santa</a>. You can then start displaying your clip at the space of your choice (e.g. an open wall area, a white sheet, or a life-size prop on the roof) for that holographic feel.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=flickering-flame-bulb>2. Flickering-Flame Bulb</h2><p>A candle flickering on a windowsill or an outside light fixture is the perfect way to set the mood for cozy holidays. Unfortunately, real candles are not exactly suitable for outdoor use, and you should definitely keep them away from your indoor Christmas tree, too.</p><p>Lucky for you, flickering-flame bulbs are here to save your holidays. These bulbs feature about a hundred internal LEDs that create the effect of a candle or a small torch within the bulb.</p><p>These bulbs are similar to conventional light bulbs that can be screwed into a standard socket. However, what makes them different is that they actually have flickering, realistic-looking flames. The best thing about them is that you can leave them on overnight and not have to worry about burning your house down while you go to sleep.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=smart-led-string-light>3. Smart LED String Light</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/strand-of-christmas-lights.jpg><p>Take your Christmas lights up a notch with a smart LED string light that will make your life easier and more colorful. With its Wi-Fi and voice-control capability, you can effortlessly control the lights from your phone and via Alexa or Google Assistant. Your tree will never be boring ever again.</p><p>Some versions even come with pre-programmed animated settings that make the lights pulse with the music, twinkle with alternating colors, and display various patterns. They are also weather-resistant, so you can use them for decorating your porch, too.</p><h2 id=outdoor-laser-light-projector>4. Outdoor Laser Light Projector</h2><p>Does hanging up strands of lights take too much of your time? Then it's time to chuck out those messy Christmas string lights and replace them with a laser light projector. It's definitely an easier way to decorate the outdoor of your home and takes little effort to set up.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Simply stake it in your lawn and you will have colorful dots covering the front of your house in no time. It comes with a variety of customizable colors and display options, including snowflakes, nativity scenes, and holiday greetings.</p><p>Some models also feature a built-in smart timer. This way, you don't have to worry about unplugging it during the day since it will switch on and off automatically.</p><h2 id=smart-christmas-tree>5. Smart Christmas Tree</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/prelit-christmas-tree.jpg><p>There's no better way to spruce up your living room than by putting up a high-tech smart tree. This tree comes pre-lit, with ornaments and toppers already attached, so you won't have to decorate it yourself.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Thanks to its smart capabilities, it can be remotely controlled from a smartphone or computer, allowing you to turn the lights on and off, create a schedule for it to operate, or set a timer for how long the tree should be on.</p><p>Some smart Christmas tree models are also compatible with voice assistants like Amazon Alexa, so you can freely add them to your smart home routine for a more convenient setup. Depending on the model, you can make changes to the light patterns, colors, and even music, too.</p><h2 id=modern-christmas-tree-topper>6. Modern Christmas Tree Topper</h2><p>If you prefer to set up a real Christmas tree and decorate it the old-fashioned way, there’s still one way you can make it a bit techy other than installing some lights: a light projector tree topper.</p><p>This star-shaped tree topper looks just like any other topper at first glance. But it actually has an integrated projector that displays a beautiful light show on your ceiling.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Depending on the model, you can pick from a range of bright colors and patterns to project. Some versions also rotate and come with an adjustable projector, so you can have the same effect at multiple different angles. It's a great and easy way to upgrade your Christmas tree and amaze your visitors.</p><h2 id=electric-fireplace>7. Electric Fireplace</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/electric-fireplace-with-christmas-decorations.jpg><p>What better way to greet your Christmas guests than with a warm, cozy fire? But if your home doesn't come with a wood-burning fireplace, you can always get an electric version.</p><p>It displays a 3D flame that makes it look like you’re burning real logs. Some models even feature a speaker with a crackling effect to complete the experience.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Aside from being aesthetically pleasing, an electric fireplace also functions as a heater. You can readily adjust the flame intensity and temperature with its remote or side panel control. On top of that, it has a built-in safety mechanism that shuts off the fireplace in the event of overheating.</p><p>Lastly, it's 100% smoke-free. It's definitely worth having this holiday season.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>The Best Electric Fireplaces for an Ambient Environment</a></span></p><h2 id=smart-speaker>8. Smart Speaker</h2><p>Tired of manually turning your Christmas lights on and off? Using any smart speaker, you can control them with just your voice. Simply <a href=#>install a smart plug</a>, connect your ‘dumb’ lights to the plug, and let Alexa or Google Assistant do the hard work for you.</p><p>On top of helping you control your holiday decorations, a smart speaker can do all sorts of tasks for you. You can use it to make shopping lists, set reminders, buy last-minute gifts, and <a href=#>entertain your guests with fun games</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Of course, the most common application of smart speakers is to play music. They can fill the house with some holiday songs and get you in the mood for the festivities.</p><h2 id=we-wish-you-a-techy-christmas>We Wish You a Techy Christmas</h2><p>No matter what decorating style you'll go for this holiday, there are now gadgets that can add a smart and geeky touch to your setup. Making the switch to these devices will not only make your home more high-tech and distinct, but it will also relieve you of the burden of decorating for hours on end.</p><p>That way, you'll have tons of free time on your hands to do what really matters: bonding with the family.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rq3KnqysnZ%2Bbe6S7zGifop%2BYYsGmr8dmmqGqmajBrq3SZpuem5%2BnrrW1zqeqaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./tibetan-herder-known-chinas-most-handsome-man.html><span>←</span><span>Tibetan herder known as Chinas most handsome man sues after criticism he is untalented and</span></a>
