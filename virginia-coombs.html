Erik Lake, a commercial pilot, and member of the Air Force Reserves had been divorced for almost three years before appearing on the show. According to reports, the 34-year-old spent his twenties focusing on his career, which had a significant impact on his previous relationships.</p><p>Virginia has also had significant commitment issues in the past. Virginia, who has been single for nearly five years (2021), has always feared abandonment as a result of her parents’ messy divorce. She had, admittedly, sabotaged many relationships in the past.</p><p>Despite the fact that Virginia was very modern and Erik appeared to be a traditional guy from a conservative family, the couple was ready to settle their differences and move forward toward a healthy married life.</p><p>Fans of Married, At First Sight, are concerned that Virginia’s excessive drinking will have a negative impact on the couple’s relationship. After Virginia took multiple shots before walking down the aisle, fans expressed their concerns on various social media platforms.</p><p>Some show viewers even worried that Virginia would have to go to rehab as a result of what she did on the wedding day.</p><p>“Virginia giving off straight alcoholic vibes,” one Internet user wrote. Perhaps she should have tried rehab before marrying,” one Twitter user suggested, while another added, “Honestly? Virginia is also an alcoholic, as Eric and his parents have discovered. She could be in rehab by the end of the season.”</p><p>While the MAFS star had previously stated that she drinks on her nights out, many believed she should be concerned about her excessive drinking.</p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>marketing agency.</a></span> <a href=#></a><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>Alyssa Snider</a></h3>Who is Alyssa Snider?
