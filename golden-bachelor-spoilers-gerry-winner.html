Gerry ended up with and got engaged to Theresa Nist, a 69-year-old financial services professional from Shrewsbury, New Jersey, in The Golden Bachelor Season 1 finale, according to Reality Steve. Gerry gave his final rose and proposed to Theresa at the Final Rose Ceremony after rejecting his runner-up, Leslie Fhima, a 64-year-old fitness instructor from Minneapolis, Minnesota.&nbsp;His third place finalist, Faith Martin, a 60-year-old high school teacher from Benton City, Washington, was eliminated after Hometown Dates.</p><p>For Gerry’s engagement, it’s almost certain the ring was designed by Neil Lane, a celebrity jeweler, who has created engagement rings for The Bachelor, The Bachelorette and Bachelor in Paradise since 2008. In a 2016 interview with <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>Entertainment Weekly</a>, former host Chris Harrison revealed that Bachelor Nation couples have to stay together for a certain amount of time, otherwise they have to return the free engagement ring to Neil Lane. “There’s some rule, after a certain number of years, you get to keep it anyway,” he said. “But after months… it goes back.”</p><p>Before who Gerry picked on The Golden Bachelor was confirmed by Reality Steve, fans speculated that Gerry chose Leslie based on a <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>TikTok video</a> Leslie posted in September 2023 of her and her granddaughter, Kiki, dancing, which fans believed Gerry recorded. “Whoever is filming starts to laugh and it weirdly sounds like Gerry’s laugh,” a Reddit user wrote. “I think he ends up with Leslie just from that video… that’s my guess!” Another commented on Leslie’s Instagram, “Ummm did I hear a tiny Gerry laugh from behind the camera?”</p><p>Fans also suspected that Gerry chose Leslie based on a video interview Gerry did with <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>Us Weekly</a>, which showed a woman in a mirror behind Gerry that looked like Leslie. “From the hair color, I think it’s Leslie,” a user commented on a video of TikTok account @<a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>ShesAllBach’s</a> repost of the video.</p><p>In an interview with <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>Entertainment Tonight</a> Canada in August 2023, Gerry explained how Fantasy Suites—which often happen with leads’ two or three finalists—were different on his season of The Golden Bachelor. “I just think that a Fantasy Suite for someone of my age may look quite different,” he said. “The activities could be quite different than for someone in their 20s and 30s.”</p><p>Gerry also told Entertainment Tonight that Fantasy suites “really don’t” make him nervous. “They make my daughters a lot more nervous than me,” he said, revealing that his daughters told him to not be physical with any of his contestants. “That they said absolutely none of that. They said don’t do it,” Gerry said, adding that he’d “been ignoring that part of the advice.”</p><p>Gerry also told <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">BachelorNation.com</a> in September 2023 about why he was both “nervous” and “excited” for his Fantasy Suites to air. “I am both nervous and excited about the Fantasy Suites, because the general assumption about Fantasy Suites is that it leads to or is the stage for a physical intimacy. And the reality was not that way at all for me,” he said.</p><p>He continued, “The Fantasy Suites that I had were the perfect opportunity for the connection to develop on a more emotional and intellectual level. It was an exchange of ideas and beliefs and values, and all of that, and those nights were genuinely watershed moments for me.”</p><p>He also confirmed that his Fantasy Suites were more for fostering an “emotional” connection with his contestants than a physical one. He said, “I think that’s the perfect way of putting it. In your 20s and 30s, you might have a different priority about the Fantasy Suites, whereas in your 70s, it’s more about an emotional connection.”</p><p>Read Theresa’s Golden Bachelor biography and fun facts ahead: “Theresa is a gorgeous catch with a huge heart.
