The iconic <a href=#>Bird Box</a> actress was absolutely glowing as she attended the 77th annual awards show on January 5.</p><p>Although she opted out of the big event’s <a href=#>red carpet arrivals</a>, the 55-year-old beauty stunned as she made her on-stage entrance to present the final award for Best Motion Picture for a Drama. After handing over the award to the cast of<strong> Sam Mendes</strong>‘ 1917, Sandra headed to the press room.</p><p>As she smiled and posed for pics, the Blind Side star — who is <a href=#>the proud mom of adopted kids</a> Louis, 10, and Laila, 8 — proved she’s ageless. Sandra couldn’t help but show off her flawless figure in a gold, asymmetrical gown. Along with her stunning ensemble, the actress accessorized with matching jewelry, including a chain-linked necklace and matching bracelet.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/sandra-bullock-golden-globes-2020-07.jpg><p>Following the award show, Sandra — who took home the Golden Globe for Best Actress in a Motion Picture Drama in 2010 — was all smiles as she was spotted at the Netflix after-party. There, she snapped a photo with fellow Hollywood superstars <a href=#><strong>Jennifer Aniston</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Glenn Close</strong></a> and <strong>Scott Stuber</strong>. How fun!</p><p>Although Sandra seemed happier than ever at the iconic awards show, we bet the doting mom of two couldn’t wait to get home to her kiddos and longtime boyfriend <a href=#><strong>Bryan Randall</strong></a>. While she’s become one of Hollywood’s most accomplished actresses throughout her decades-long career, nothing is more important to Sandra than motherhood. In fact, sources tell Closer Weekly Sandra is so dead-set on giving her kids a normal upbringing, <a href=#>Louis and Laila don’t even realize their mom’s celebrity status</a>!</p><p>“They don’t really know that their mother is a huge movie star, they just know her as mommy,” the insider exclusively shared with Closer in June 2019. “Louis and Laila are two of the most polite and well behaved children I know. There’s not an ounce of brattiness, what you might expect from Hollywood kids, and that’s because Sandra is nothing but a mom to them.”</p><p><strong>Scroll through the gallery below to see more pics of Sandra on the red carpet!</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46smKecopZ6o8HLpaaco12owba60magp2WXpLmlecaorqdlkal6qLvLnZynZZehvKOx0mZpaWpgYr2pu9Ooqmg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./meaning-of-i-be-on-that-by-childish-gambino.html><span>←</span><span>Meaning of I Be On That by Childish Gambino</span></a>
