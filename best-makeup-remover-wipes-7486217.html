You’ll find these trusty wipes everywhere,&nbsp;from your favorite makeup artist’s kit to your teenage cousin’s bedside table. The brand offers several iterations of these makeup wipes, but we’re particularly fond of the fragrance-free version thanks to its non-irritating formula and simple ingredient list.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The micellar-infused wipes dissolves dirt, bacteria, makeup, sunscreen, and sweat with just a few swipes, making them extremely effective for low-effort makeup removal. And while single-use makeup wipes aren’t the most sustainable option, these are biodegradable and compostable.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Though these wipes have been around for years, Neutrogena recently reformulated them and we find that they’re not quite as saturated as they used to be. This has led to a bit of skin tugging, though not enough to cause any irritation.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Wipes per pack: </strong>25 | <strong>Key Ingredients: </strong>Water, capric glycerides | <strong>Biodegradable: </strong>Yes</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-budget-cerave-hydrating-makeup-removing-plant-based-wipes></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Budget</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>CeraVe Hydrating Makeup Removing Plant-Based Wipes</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="CeraVe Hydrating Makeup Removing Plant-Based Wipes" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/HQrpUAatvv8GaDwug9_aOaaham4=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/CeraVe-Hydrating-Makeup-Removing-Plant-Based-Wipes-e5db7b2e6aa84a9c9c221d99148e7e52.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Target</p></span><p><strong>What We Love:</strong> CeraVe’s hydrating wipes are ultra-gentle on skin and don’t leave behind a greasy film like some makeup remover wipes are wont to do.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>Despite the fragrance-free formula, the wipes have a chemical-like scent.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Infused with ceramides and glycerin, CeraVe’s makeup removing wipes leave skin feeling clean and refreshed — with none of the tightness or greasy residue other makeup remover wipes often cause. The formula is alcohol-free, oil-free, and non-comedogenic, not to mention sensitive skin-, allergy-, and ophthalmologist-tested for a gentle cleanse that leaves the skin barrier intact and irritation-free. We also appreciate that the wipes are plant-based and biodegradable, which helps to minimize any negative implications on the environment.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">It’s worth noting that though the formula is fragrance-free, the wipes have a chemical-like scent. It isn’t overpowering in any way, but we’d be lying if we said it wasn’t a little off-putting.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Wipes per pack: </strong>25 | <strong>Key Ingredients: </strong>Ceramides, glycerin | <strong>Biodegradable: </strong>Yes</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-splurge-cle-de-peau-makeup-cleansing-towelettes></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Splurge</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Cle de Peau Makeup Cleansing Towelettes</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Cle de Peau Makeup Cleansing Towelettes" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/EPWPdpqA2YRZe_ossqySqYyWsXQ=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Cle-de-Peau-Makeup-Cleansing-Towelettes-22ba31f1c03b4a4387a4bfb35b278bd7.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Cle de Peau</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>From the packaging and formulation to the plush texture, everything about these wipes is downright luxurious.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> Similar to the Neutrogena wipes, these were recently reformulated and aren’t as saturated as they used to be.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">At $1 a wipe ($50 for a pack of 50 wipes), we expect quite the experience, and Cle de Peau’s Makeup Cleansing Towelettes really do deliver. The formula is unlike any makeup remover wipe we’ve come across: It’s packed with superfoods and plant-based ingredients (like mangosteen extract, hyaluronic acid, and peppermint extract) that are rich in antioxidants to guard against environmental aggressors; as well as camellia and argan oils to hydrate and repair the skin barrier (and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>help strengthen lashes</a>, too!). We’re also fans of the packaging, which features a snap closure to ensure unused towelettes stay moist.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Just like the Neutrogena wipes, Cle de Peau recently reformulated these towelettes. Though they’re not quite as saturated as they used to be, we find that they still effectively cleanse our face without any tugging or irritation.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Wipes per pack: </strong>50 | <strong>Key Ingredients: </strong>Hyaluronic acid, mangosteen extract, peppermint extract, camellia and argan oil | <strong>Biodegradable: </strong>Yes</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-sensitive-skin-paulas-choice-gentle-cleansing-cloths></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best for Sensitive Skin</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Paula's Choice Gentle Cleansing Cloths</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Paula's Choice Gentle Cleansing Cloths" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/4CRfSll_ljVdWcdP7MVY3tx9Ohc=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Paulas-Choice-Gentle-Cleansing-Cloths-950cd9887a8244deb134ea712d9b9a6a.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Paula's Choice</p></span><p><strong>What We Love:</strong> These three-in-one wipes function as a makeup remover, cleanser, and toner ultimately simplifying your routine.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> The sealant on the packaging becomes less effective over time, rendering the wipes dry.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The Paula’s Choice Gentle Cleansing Cloths combine cleansing agents with hydrating and soothing ingredients to quickly remove even the most stubborn makeup without compromising skin. The durable, non-abrasive towelettes are infused with glycerin and panthenol, which actively hydrate the skin, while chamomile, oat, and pomegranate work to soothe and calm irritation at the source.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Rather than tugging or pulling like many wipes are known to do, these glide, making them <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>perfect for sensitive, irritation-prone skin</a>. Plus, you can knock out three steps of your routine with these towelettes, as they effectively remove makeup, cleanse skin, and function as a toner.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-21 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">As is the case with most cleansing wipes, the sealant on the packaging seems to get less effective over time. This can cause the wipes to dry up, making them virtually unusable. That said, pressing out any excess air before resealing the package can help with this issue.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Wipes per pack: </strong>30 | <strong>Key Ingredients: </strong>Glycerin, panthenol, chamomile, oat, pomegranate | <strong>Biodegradable: </strong>No</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-eye-makeup-clinique-take-the-day-off-micellar-cleansing-towelettes></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best for Eye Makeup</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Clinique Micellar Cleansing Towelettes</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1001 data-sizes=750px alt="Clinique Take the Day Off Micellar Cleansing Towelettes" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/XquXnwT6PqVc5XbqnoCnTnUyRm0=/fit-in/1500x1001/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Clinique-Take-The-Day-Off-Micellar-Cleansing-Towelettes-for-Face--Eye-Makeup-1914392536d6454ba39e37c2f92cabc3.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Ulta</p></span><p><strong>What We Love:</strong> These ready-to-go towelettes are saturated with a gentle micellar cleansing liquid that whisks away waterproof makeup without needing to scrub.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> The packaging dispenses several wipes at a time and it’s difficult to shove the excess ones back in.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Eye makeup can be notoriously stubborn to remove (even non-waterproof formulas). Though using a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>cleansing balm</a> is the easiest way to dissolve eye makeup, when you’re in a pinch, Clinique Take The Day Off Micellar Cleansing Towelettes come to the rescue. Infused with a micellar cleansing liquid that effectively cuts through dirt, grime, sunscreen, and even <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>waterproof mascara</a>, these wipes quickly remove all kinds of makeup without intense scrubbing —&nbsp;a majorly impressive feat.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Beyond the wipes themselves, we love the resealable packaging with its click-into-place top.

A three-percent AHA/BHA complex exfoliates dead skin cells and unclogs pores, while anti-inflammatory ingredients, like green tea and aloe vera, soothe irritation and calm skin, ultimately leaving complexions feeling plump and hydrated rather than stripped.

The soap-free towelettes effectively remove makeup, sunscreen, and daily grime without irritating the skin, thanks to the inclusion of soothing ingredients like allantoin.

And we have a sneaking suspicion that’s just what he made these wipes for — actually doing makeup. Infused with refreshing cucumber water, his wipes are lightly saturated with formula for ultra-precise makeup removal. This makes them perfect for wiping away any fallout under the eyes, removing failed cat-eye wings, and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>carving out the perfect contour</a>.
