JENN,</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">My girlfriend and I have rearranged our apartment, made our own bread, and watched everything on Netflix... but I'm bored. What can we do to not lose our minds, especially now that it's getting cold and we'll be forced to spend even more time inside? We desperately need to change things up when it comes to our date nights. —Stir Crazy</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>DEAR STIR CRAZY,</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">There is nothing more romantic and cozy than lighting a fire and curling up together during these tumultuous times. Keeping each other warm, connecting, and getting into the holiday spirit are great ways to bond. I've shared some <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>creative quarantine dates</a> but here's your winter edition to help you get creative at home during the cold weather season.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>1. Watch holiday movies together.</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Whether you watch a classic like “It’s a Wonderful Life” or “Miracle on 34th Street,’ a more recent family-friendly flick like “The Muppet Christmas Carol," or an edgier take of the holidays with “The Nightmare Before Christmas", taking a deep dive into holiday movie will get you in the spirit. Throw in some eggnog or hot chocolate and cuddle up on the couch in an ugly Christmas sweater.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>2. Plan your Thanksgiving menu.</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Even if it's just going to be the two of you or a Zoom dinner with family across the country, there's no reason you can't make the day memorable and thoughtful. Start planning what you are going to make (you might even want to try an online holiday cooking class together!), how you are going to set the table, and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>what you are going to wear</a>.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_17-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>3. Share stories about childhood holidays.</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Share your family history with your partner, including both good and bad memories. This is the best way to carry on fun family traditions with your partner. Sharing painful memories can help you to get closer and make sure that you create new happier ones together.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_20-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>4. Make something special for the cold weather.</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_21-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Take an online knitting class, sewing tutorial, or anything else that will help you both to develop a new skill. Then use it to make a warm blanket, sweater, or scarf.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_23-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>5. Make a gingerbread house.</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_24-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Have fun building a home together (literally and figuratively) with some gingerbread. Buy a kit or just wing it together.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_26-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>6. Get handsy.</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_27-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Heat up some warm massage oil and give each other back rubs. Learn some new techniques online and take turns trying them out on one another. Even better, do your massage in front of a flickering fire. If you don't have a fireplace, go the virtual route and play a video of flames on your TV.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_31-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>7. Plan a fantasy trip.</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_32-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Look through travel websites, Instagram, or Pinterest and plan a fantasy vacation together somewhere warm.

Decorate for the holidays.</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_35-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Getting your home in the holiday spirit together will keep you busy and make your home cozier and more inviting. String lights, carve a pumpkin, make a wreath for your front door, pull out your menorah, decorate a tree.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_37-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>9.
