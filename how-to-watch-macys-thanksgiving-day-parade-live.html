Well, one way is better than the rest.</p><p>The <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade</a> started in 1924 as a march with Macy’s employees to Macy’s Herald Square, the brand’s flagship store on 34th Street in New York City. The parade saw the employees dressed in vibrant costumes, alongside floats, professional bands and live animals from the Central Park Zoo. Since that first parade, which saw an audience of more than 250,000 people, the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>Macy’s Thanksgiving Day</a> Parade has become an annual event. As of 2021, it’s tied for the second-oldest Thanksgiving Parade in the United States, alongside America’s Thanksgiving Parade in Detroit Michigan. (The oldest thanksgiving parade is Philadelphia’s Thanksgiving Day Parade, which started in 1920.)</p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/shaperx-bodysuit-tiktok.png> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/patrick-mahomes-kansas-city-chiefs.png><p>The parade—which runs from 8:30 a.m. to 12 p.m. on <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>Thanksgiving</a> and ends outside of Macy’s Herald Square—has been televised on NBC since 1953.
