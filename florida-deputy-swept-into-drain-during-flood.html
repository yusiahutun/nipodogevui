As he stepped out into the water, however, he was quickly pulled under it. His bodycam footage goes black, but in the video below, viewers can hear muffled noises which sound like screams for help and gasps for air.</p><p>Waiting for your permission to load the Facebook Video.</p><p>After traveling 100 feet underwater from one side of the four-lane highway to the other, both men were spit out of the pipe and back into the flood water. At that point, Hollingsworth can be heard yelling at the driver about what they had just experienced.</p><p>"Can you f---ing believe what just happened to us? You okay bud? Can you believe what f---ing happened to us?!" exclaimed the deputy. "Just breathe. Oh my god, thank you Jesus! Oh Jesus."</p><p>"I never held my breath like this in my life," Hollingsworth continued, as the driver added, "Me neither!"</p><p>The deputy then radioed for help, saying they'll be "staying put" to avoid getting "sucked down again." After backup arrived, Hollingsworth told them, "I got sucked in the f--king drain pipe and I went all the way under highway 98 and got spit out."</p><p>The driver can be seen thanking the officer for trying to help and for rushing over to make sure he was okay following the ordeal. As the driver was waiting to get checked out by an ambulance, he told the deputy, "Me and you man ... that's an experience for life."</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:354cca7a-a806-426f-8210-32f0302a2c2d data-container-ref=toofab:article:ab69e6d8-82d1-42c5-a5d1-748746b5305b data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/c7/5by4/2023/06/08/c76af6bf2d1d4ec0bd06bc72240396b5_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">8NewsNow/Las Vegas Metro Police Department</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Police Spy Something Fall from Sky Moments Before 911 Call About 'Aliens' In Viral Video</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>In a Facebook post about the incident, the Sheriff's Office explained the area had been experiencing "severe weather and torrential downpours" in the days leading up to Friday.</p><p>"During the rescue attempt, both the citizen and Deputy Hollingsworth were sucked into a drainage pipe and were swept underneath the four-lane roadway of Hwy 98.
