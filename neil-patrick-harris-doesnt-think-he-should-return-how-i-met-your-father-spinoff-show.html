The pair talked about the character in the latest installment of his newsletter, <a href=#>Wondercade</a>.</p><p>It was Duff who brought the idea of Barney coming over to "HIMYF" during their interview, with Harris quickly shutting down the idea.</p><p>"As for coming on your show (insert joke here), I worry," Harris told her, per <a href=#>TVLine</a>. "Barney’s antics, his overt delusions of grandeur, would likely get everyone in trouble. So, unless he’s changed his ways or joined a nunnery (insert an insert joke here), not sure if it’s in anyone’s best interest."</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:68176092-cf26-49b6-a5b1-dc1e32e84d33 data-container-ref=toofab:article:87a3edb9-1af8-463c-95ee-26064830607f data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/da/5by4/2022/01/26/da988d857ad34aed906c779c16217a75_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Hilary Duff's Husband Tries to Embarrass Her in Front of Ex-Boyfriend at Dinner</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>Duff had to agree, noting that all of the tricks that had people laughing and rolling their eyes at him during the show's original run would probably have him in legal hot water in this post-#MeToo era.</p><p>"I'm not sure how you feel about this, but I’m pretty sure Barney would… be in jail in 2022," she laughed. She also speculated that the shift we're seeing culturally in women gaining ownership over themselves and starting to find their own power is why the Barney character was also gender-flipped into Valentina, portrayed by Francia Raisa.</p><p>She's also more of a sexual free spirit than someone who hounds the opposite sex relentlessly and inappropriately, never taking no for an answer. Even Carter Bays, who created "HIMYM" has said that he'd love to "go George Lucas" on the show and "remove certain stuff I really wish wasn’t in there and I bet nobody would miss."</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:93a77a48-d5d9-4ef0-bc4b-229b7cfd6af0 data-container-ref=toofab:article:87a3edb9-1af8-463c-95ee-26064830607f data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=29><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/df/5by4/2022/01/18/df6c76db24db4c47ad6faa6263339b6d_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Hulu</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">How I Met Your Father Premiere Already Narrows It Down -- Plus, Surprise HIMYM Connection</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>But, what NPH is missing is that there is an opportunity here to at least somewhat redeem the character of Barney even more than his relationship with Robin did during the show's original run. Rather than avoid him, and older and wiser Barney could show up having learned from his past experiences.</p><p>A newer fan theory has it that Barney could even be the father of Duff's character Sophie, though that would make the apartment connection even cornier. Still, the idea of Barney having to raise a daughter would go a long way to helping him grow up. It might be good to see what he learned from #MeToo and how he can still be Barney without all that awfulness.</p><p>It would also be proof that not everything has to be canceled that no longer fits into our progressing society. It's also possible to grow, adapt and change into a better version of yourself. If Barney Stinson could find that better version, than anyone could, right?</p><a id=gallery-link-dd2ea134-d843-47e3-bb42-8617405c1e1e class="media-link gallery-block__link js-track-link js-click-gallery" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:gallery:dd2ea134-d843-47e3-bb42-8617405c1e1e data-context='{"name":"gallery-block","section":"permalink"}' data-container-ref=toofab:article:87a3edb9-1af8-463c-95ee-26064830607f data-gallery-layout=carousel><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/47/4by3/2022/02/02/470e8c28b66f4623ab3e4dc70164341d_md.jpg width=825 height=618 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3N7j2tmaWtfo7KquIypmK2qmZi4brTAq6miq12ZvKa%2Fza1kraCZo7hutMRmqqGnpaGxbr7Erayrpl2dvLh5yGaknqxdrry2voyfmK2glad6tLzIp6afnl2otbDDjg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./gary-neville-restaurant-close-hotel-30381996.html><span>←</span><span>Restaurant inside Gary Neville's hotel shuts down after just four months</span></a>
