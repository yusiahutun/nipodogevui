I had just finished 'House Bunny,' and I'd sold another movie, all of these new things were happening to me, so I got my breasts done," Faris said. "It was f-cking awesome. I never, ever thought I'd do something like that. I always thought plastic surgery was caving in to 'the man,' you know? But it came down to a really simple thing: I wanted to fill out a bikini."</p><p>But plastic surgery forced her to question her feminist identity: "I'm still floored that I did it, because I am a staunch feminist. I kept thinking, 'Am I betraying my own gender by doing this?'"</p><p>"I wish that we were more supportive of each other," she continued. "I think that people should be able to do whatever they want, whether it's getting braces, bleaching their hair, getting extensions, getting a boob job, getting vaginal surgery or getting a nose job."</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:e953d2d3-51ae-5c0a-8f13-98bfc662fc41 data-container-ref=toofab:article:781be51e-7c6a-5dd6-924d-43dff71037b4 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=28><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/83/5by4/2017/12/21/837447a4a7b956ec915ece793ba820b6_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">MGM Studios</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Trailer for Anna Faris' Gender-Swapped 'Overboard' Remake Begs the Question: 'Do We Really Need This?'</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>Faris was just as positive about her recent divorce. In the aftermath of the split -- which <strong><a href=#>broke Twitter's collective heart</a></strong> at the time -- it's all about their young son, Jack.</p><p>"What Chris and I try to do is to communicate openly. We reiterate that there aren't rules to this. We have a lot of love and friendship, and our big goal is to protect Jack," Faris said. "I cherish my family, my close friends, my child -- that makes the rest of it worth it."</p><p>Her outlook on love hasn't been jaded, either. She's currently swooning over boyfriend Michael Barrett -- the cinematographer for "Overboard."</p><p>"I love love! Like all of us, I need a sense of human connection and intimacy. At the end of a workday I feel exposed and kind of raw," Faris said. "I want to be with someone I can confess to, and who can confess to me."</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/a7/o/2018/04/10/a7e9839d65be5cf4a2892199a2967d12_md.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit image-block__media-credit">Jeff Lipsky for Women's Health</span> <a class="media-link image-block__link js-track-link" href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/b8/o/2018/03/05/b8ddfccc73a55a9f91f3935c26b2cef3_md.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlfnl7j21mamhflruvrYyfmKuho2KvsLvBZqGoml2Ztre70ZycZpuYp7a0ec%2BrmK2sXw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./yellowstone-1923-easter-egg-whiskey-glasses-dutton-rules.html><span>←</span><span>'Yellowstone' Fans Noticed the Coolest '1923' Easter Egg</span></a>
