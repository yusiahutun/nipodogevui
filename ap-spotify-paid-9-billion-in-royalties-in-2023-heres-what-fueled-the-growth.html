“This is everything we know about how much is being paid out, how many artists are achieving different levels of success,” says Charlie Hellman, the vice president and global head of music product at Spotify."><meta name=author content="Aldo Pusey"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

They might, you know, have gigs listed on Spotify or things like that,” he says.</p><p>In December, Spotify announced it was axing 17% of its global workforce, the music streaming service’s third round of layoffs in 2023 as it moved to slash costs while focusing on becoming profitable.</p><p>The previous month, Spotify announced it would eliminate payments for songs with less than 1,000 annual streams, starting in 2024.</p><p>“Songs that generate less than a thousand streams in a year would be generating pennies, a few cents in royalties,” Hellman explains. “So what we’re seeing was that there was an increasing amount of uploaders that had $0.03, $0.08, $0.36 sitting there.”</p><p>For those DIY artists, there’s a minimum threshold to withdraw money from a distributor — $5.35 at DistroKid and $1 at TuneCore, two such distributors — and Hellman argues the withdrawal fees would eclipse the royalties.</p><p>Spotify — and most other streaming services — pay royalties to the rights holders of the music on its platform, a number which is determined by “streamshare.” That’s calculated by adding up how many times music owned or controlled by a particular rights holder was streamed and dividing by the total number of streams in that market.</p><p>In short: Larger rights holders have a larger percentage of the market share. And a listener streaming an artist 25% of the time does not mean the act receives 25% of the listener’s subscription fee.</p><p>“All those pennies sitting in bank accounts all over the place was siphoning money away from artists that were really doing this, as an aspiring professional,” says Hellman of the decision. “And so, those royalties are now being put in the pot so that they can be redirected to artists that are getting more than a thousand streams a year.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7sMHRqqyanJOewaqx0meaqKVfo7K4v46brKyhnprAtHvAqWSbraOeu6a%2F0miYqWWjpby1tcWyZKmZmZl6ennBoqOloZ%2Bjeqq6jKumspmcqbamv4yipWZqYGeAbrTEq5ysZaedrrV5xa6cpZ2UYsGpsYygqaivpJ18</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./spanakopita.html><span>←</span><span>spanakopita</span></a>
