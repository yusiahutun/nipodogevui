The Grammy-nominated singer has revealed that his fourth studio album, Stereotype, is set for release on April 8.</p><p>The 13-track project features his No. 1 hit "Single Saturday Night." Swindell's smoldering duet with <a href=#>Lainey Wilson</a>, "Never Say Never," is one of two collaborations on the album. The other is a joint effort with <a href=#>Hardy</a> titled "Down to the Bar," which inspired the title for Swindell's <a href=#>upcoming tour</a>.</p><p>“I am so proud of this album and excited for everyone to hear what we have been working on,” Swindell says in a press release. “I’ve always had a ‘best song wins’ attitude when recording an album and I hope every song we recorded for Stereotype makes you feel something. I can’t wait for the Down to the Bar Tour to start and play some of these songs for the fans.”</p><p>Swindell's writing is all over the album, as he co-wrote seven out of the 13 songs, including the title track. Other songwriting credits include <a href=#>Thomas Rhett</a> on "She Had Me at Heads Carolina" and <a href=#>Dustin Lynch</a> on "I'm Gonna Let Her,"&nbsp; which Swindell has released in celebration of the album's announcement.</p><p>"I'm Gonna Let Her" tells the story of a man falling in love. As his heart opens, he finds himself leaning into all the things that love brings.</p><p>"And I'm gonna let her / To keep on makin’ this life of mine a little better / Showin’ me all about love right down to the letter / So if she wants to think I’m thinkin’ ‘bout forever / I’m gonna let her,"&nbsp;Swindell sings in the chorus.</p><p>Swindell will embark on the Down to the Bar Tour on Feb. 17. <a href=#>Travis Denning</a> and Ashley Cooke will join him on the road. The trek will continue through April 3.</p><h3>Cole Swindell, Stereotype Tracklisting:</h3><p>1. "Stereotype" (Cole Swindell, Michael Hardy, Jordan Schmidt)<br>2.
