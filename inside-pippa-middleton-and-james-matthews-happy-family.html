Their extravagant nuptials took place at St Mark’s Church in the Berkshire village of Englefield. Several high-profile guests, including Prince Harry, Princess Beatrice and Princess Eugenie, attended the wedding.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Topic class="css-1wyvcgo e1b1x8aa3"></span><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Title class="css-i31uou e1b1x8aa1">5 best British royal wedding dresses, from Queen Elizabeth to Meghan Markle</span></p></a></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/07/22/b1ce6eb4-a4cb-4216-86f0-898bb9649e45_5acdb6cf.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">But possibly because of their own high-profile lives, the Middleton sisters have made quieter arrangements for their children. According to some reports, Pippa plans to move her family to the country, away from the press. The Cambridges announced similar arrangements for the royal children.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Pippa and Matthews recently bought a £15 million (US$18 million) home in Berkshire near Bucklebury. It is the place where Pippa, along with her siblings, grew up. Aside from that, their parents are still living in Berkshire.</p>Meanwhile, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">also plan to move to Berkshire</span></a>.

Their paths first crossed back in 2007. At that time, they met at the luxury Eden Rock hotel in St Bart’s owned by Matthews’ parents. About five years later, in late 2012, they were spotted dining together.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/07/22/bc10f0bd-d8d3-437b-9f09-e3dc2db2e351_86622518.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Unfortunately, the romance rumours between the two ended when Middleton confirmed her relationship with Nico Jackson in 2013. However, that relationship eventually ended in 2015.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">After some time, Middleton was spotted visiting the house of Matthews. In 2016, the two of them attended a charity event together and went on a ski trip.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">The wedding and domestic bliss</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/07/22/1c623fc8-a7c7-481d-bbfd-83635b1cc258_47d81782.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The couple confirmed through a public announcement their engagement in July 2016.

The venue is near the Middleton family home in Bucklebury, England.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Two years later, it was in October 2018 when the couple welcomed their first child, Arthur. Meanwhile, Middleton gave birth to their second child, Grace, in 2021. Her daughter shares her middle name, Elizabeth, with her aunt, Duchess Kate.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In June 2022, Middleton confirmed her pregnancy for their third baby. Soon after, the couple welcomed their third bundle of joy. Despite their high-profile status, they were able to maintain an intimate and low-key relationship.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The couple currently lives in their house in London, which costs US$22 million. It is a five-story and six-bedroom residence, including an underground cinema and a gym. They began renovating the property the same year they got married.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Matthews works in finance; he is also the heir to the Scottish title of Laird of Glen Affric.
