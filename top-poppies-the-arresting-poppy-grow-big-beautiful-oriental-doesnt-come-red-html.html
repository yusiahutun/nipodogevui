But over the past 100 years or so dozens of colours have been bred. If you like the earliness and upright qualities of ‘Beauty of Livermere’ but prefer it in pink, then ‘Big Jim’ has all these qualities and flowers that are a deep, almost magenta pink.</span></p><h2>RELATED ARTICLES</h2><ul class="rotator-pages link-xocc"><li class=rotator-prev><a href=# data-page=prev>Previous</a></li><li><a href=# data-page=1>1</a></li><li class=rotator-next><a href=# data-page=next>Next</a></li></ul><ul class="rotator-panels link-bogr1 linkro-ccox"><li><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2012/06/15/article-2159755-139F891E000005DC-316_87x84.jpg width=62 height=60 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto> <span>ASK MONTY: Why did my three-year-old daphne not flower this year?</span></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2012/06/15/article-2159762-139F8A23000005DC-808_87x84.jpg width=62 height=60 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto> <span>Euphorbia euphoria!

For a start they should always be supported to stop them falling over their neighbouring plants and reducing them to a soggy mush. The time to do this is as they start growing, before they need it, since a fallen plant, scooped up from the horizontal, never looks quite the same.</span></p><p><span>If you leave the flowering stem after the flower has finished, a seed pod forms which in due course will scatter its seed. However, it is better to remove it and all the leaves, cutting back to the base as soon as the flowering has finished. This will let in light, air and water, and encourage it to regrow to give you a second flowering later in the summer. It will also create room to plant a tender annual that will have enough time to get established before the poppy foliage begins to regrow.</span></p><p><span>Although the plants grow easily from seed, they are often muddy in colour. If you want to reproduce the same flower colours, the easiest way is to lift the plants in autumn, divide them and replant the pieces.</span></p><p><span>They also take easily from root cuttings. This is a slower method of getting new plants but more prolific. Lift a plant you like sometime in August or September and cut off sections of root about the thickness of a pencil into 5cm (2in) lengths. Stick these round the edge of a pot filled with a very gritty compost so that the tops are just below the surface, and put them in a cold frame or greenhouse. The following spring pot the rooted cuttings into individual pots and keep them in the pots all summer before planting them out in autumn, and they will flower the subsequent year.<br></span></p><h3 style=font-weight:700 class=wocc>IS YOUR GARDEN A WINNER?</h3><p><span><span style=font-weight:700>THE MAIL NATIONAL GARDEN COMPETITION 2012</span><br></span></p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2012/06/15/article-2159751-139F8959000005DC-474_233x198.jpg height=198 width=233 alt="The Surrey garden of 2011 finalists Sue and Geoff Baines" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>The Surrey garden of 2011 finalists Sue<br>and Geoff Baines</p><p><span>This is your last chance to enter the Daily Mail</span> <span>National Garden Competition, the country’s most </span><span>prestigious horticultural contest.<br></span></p><p><span>It doesn’t matter </span><span>whether you have a balcony, a cottage garden or</span> <span>acres of land, you could win £2,000 and a specially </span><span>commissioned plaque.<br></span></p><p><span>So if you’re proud of your </span><span>garden, don’t miss this opportunity to enter the </span><span>most exciting garden competition of the year. </span><span><br></span></p><p><span>HOW TO ENTER</span><br></p><ul><li><span>Send your entry to National Garden Competition,</span> <span>PO Box 485, Fleet GU51 9FF by Friday 22 June and </span><span>include the following: between four and eight </span><span>photographs of your garden (which cannot be</span> <span>returned); a plan of your garden; your name, </span><span>address, contact phone numbers (including</span><br><span>mobile phone) and email.</span><br></li><li><span>The judges will make a shortlist of the gardens</span> <span>they wish to visit, from which the four finalists will </span><span>be decided.
