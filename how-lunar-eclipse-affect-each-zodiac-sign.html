Themes of commitment, financial security, and self-reliance are likely at the top of your mind, as unexpected breakthroughs are encouraging you to move forward in a positive and self-enriching manner.</p><p>How have your commitments and personal values evolved and transformed in the last couple of years? What is no longer fruitful or stable in your life? This month’s full-moon-lunar-eclipse will <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">take place on October 28</a> at exactly 4:24 p.m. ET, via 5 degrees Taurus. In addition to everything you’ve accomplished and realized, this eclipse is highlighting what lacks a practical, consistent, and grounded foundation in your life. What do you need to strengthen, solidify, and commit to in order for you to live your best life? What are you willing to live without in order to receive something even better in the long run? Do not fear—this eclipse is leading you toward your ultimate destiny.</p><p>This is the final eclipse of 2023, bringing the Taurus-Scorpio eclipse series that started way back in 2021 to a close. Where does this astrological axis exist <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>in your birth chart</a>? The <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">astrological houses</a> occupied by these zodiac signs speak to your personal stability and shared resources. Taurus is ruled by Venus—planet of beauty, security, and self-worth. On the other hand, Scorpio is ruled by Pluto and Mars, symbolizing everything from the way you regenerate after trauma to the way you embrace and accept intimacy. After all, the relationship you have with yourself (Taurus) is a prelude to the relationship you have with others (Scorpio).</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Copy-of-List-Redirect-Design-20-1.png><p>This full moon is not just like any other full moon, but something much stronger and more life-changing. A lunar eclipse takes place when the Earth casts its shadow on the moon, making it a more intense and transformative experience. This marks an emotional turning point, as it will usher in life-altering changes between now and the next six months. As for the astrology surrounding this eclipse, it is both auspicious and supportive, thanks to the benevolent influence of <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>Jupiter retrograde in Taurus</a>. The Greater Benefic planet is symbolic of expansion, opportunity, and spiritual growth; you could experience these new energies before and/or after it stations direct in December.</p><figure class=wp-block-pullquote readability=1><p>The full moon lunar eclipse in Taurus takes place on October 28 at 4:24 p.m. ET.</p></figure><p>Love planet <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>Venus—the celestial ruler of this eclipse</a>—is currently transiting the methodical and practical sign of Virgo. This is highlighting everything from our daily devotions to the way we maximize our routines. Do your day-to-day affairs contribute to your sense of security? Do they make you more self-reliant? Is there something that needs to be tweaked or reconsidered? This is an opportunity to integrate a deeper mindfulness when it comes to our craft, thanks to Venus in Virgo. Venus will eventually meet with innovative Uranus in a productive trine after the eclipse, bringing forth deeper insights and unveiling game-changing solutions for the future.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Copy-of-List-Redirect-Design-21-1.png><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=how-the-lunar-eclipse-will-affect-each-zodiac-sign>How the Lunar Eclipse Will Affect Each Zodiac Sign</h2><p>Here’s what you can expect from the upcoming lunar eclipse in Taurus, according to <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>your sun sign</a> and/or <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>rising sign</a> (and seriously, you’re missing out if you don’t read these horoscopes for your rising sign):</p><ul class="pmc-fallback-list-items lrv-a-unstyle-list lrv-u-margin-t-2"><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=2.88><h2>Aries</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Aries.png><p>October’s full moon lunar eclipse marks the ending of a major chapter in your life, especially when it comes to your finances, creature comforts, and overall sense of security. And while this full-circle moment sheds light on everything you’ve accomplished and manifested over the past year, Venus encourages you to celebrate the little things you find gratitude in the little things. La luna will also be sitting close to Jupiter retrograde in Taurus, suggesting the likelihood of you being blessed with more abundance and opportunity from now until the end of the year. Remember who you are and what you’re capable of accomplishing and providing for yourself, without the strings attached to someone else’s help. Take care of yourself like a lover, because there’s a special kind of love that only you can give yourself. <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>Read your full monthly horoscope here</a>.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=2.8831578947368><h2>Taurus</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Taurus.png><p>Although manifesting and making wishes isn’t advised under the volatile energy of an eclipse, let’s not forget you’re still the main character of this lunar event, Taurus. How have your relationship dynamics evolved in the past two years? Are your commitments in alignment with your sense of self worth and overall sense of stability? If not, then it may be time to part ways with what is no longer in alignment with you. With Venus—your celestial ruler—transiting dutiful Virgo (via your fifth house of love, passion, and fertility), everything from the topic of children to the pursuit of your artistic craft could be of greater emphasis at this time. If your values have shifted, consider this a wake-up call. It’s time to commit to yourself even more deeply than ever before. Something you’ve been creating may finally be coming to light. <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>Read your full monthly horoscope here</a>.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=2.882787750792><h2>Gemini</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Gemini.png><p>October’s lunar eclipse will ignite your 12th house of surrender, closure, and unconscious patterns. This is not only bringing awareness to your self-sabotaging patterns and coping mechanisms, but also urging you to leave a past version of yourself behind. You’re coming to terms with all the ways you’ve outgrown your former circumstances. And if you’re willing to embrace an internal transformation, you will establish a deeper mindfulness in the process. Welcome home, Gemini. With Venus transiting your fourth house of physical and emotional foundations, you may see a conclusive shift when it comes to your habitual energies and the duties you’ve followed up with on a daily basis; the duties that make you feel more safe and supported. The key is to commit to a practical plan of action, so you can feel safe and secure in your reality.&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>Read your full monthly horoscope here</a>.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=4.8012889366273><h2>Cancer</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Cancer.png><p>An eclipse always arrives with a full-circle moment. This time, it has everything to do with your contribution in the world, Cancer. Charging up your socially conscious 11th house of associations and sense of belonging in the world, October’s lunar eclipse will sit right next to Jupiter retrograde in Taurus. This highlights the stability and excitement of your network and social connections, as well as your hopes and dreams for the future. Also, the ruler of the eclipse (Venus) will be transiting your third house of communication, thought processes, siblings, close friends, and local surroundings, which could bring unexpected information to the surface. Are you in the right headspace to commit to these personal and professional goals? It’s time lean on the support of your community, because it’s grown in beautiful ways. <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>Read your full monthly horoscope here</a>.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=2.3871951219512><h2>Leo</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Leo.png><p>Are you comfortable with taking the lead and assuming a position of authority? Or are you more fond of the “idea” of being in charge instead? This month’s lunar eclipse will shake up your bossy 10th house of authority, legacy, and reputation in the world. But while in close proximity to Jupiter retrograde, you could be confronted with new ventures and opportunities for furthering your career between now and the end of 2023. This is especially true with Venus (the ruler of this eclipse) transiting your second house of finances. However, it’s important to reflect on what you value and prioritize most, as money is only a means to an end. What you think is important will therefore become important, so choose wisely. <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>Read your full monthly horoscope here</a>.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=2.888665997994><h2>Virgo</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Virgo.png><p>The growth you desire is found once you venture into the unknown, but there’s nothing to be afraid of, Virgo. October’s lunar eclipse concludes an eclipse series that started back in 2021, and this journey has brought you to unexplored places and uncharted vistas that have deepened your sense of self. Prepare to try something new; to spread your wings and fly higher than you were brave enough to in the past. This eclipse is charging up your ninth of beliefs systems and worldly expansion, renewing your faith in what you’ve been investing your energy into. There’s no such thing as perfect, so be gentle with yourself as this full-circle moment encourages you to reflect on the foundation of your personal life and the level of accountability you take.

And with Venus transiting your 12th house of closure, self-sabotage, and unconscious patterns during this time, you may also be confronted with what’s really influencing your psychological and emotional instincts. You may have once believed that having power and control over your relationships is what truly matters, but the last eclipse of the Taurus-Scorpio series is here to support your healing process. It’s time to embrace a healthier understanding of love, boundaries, and intimate exchange. If something has been triggering your vulnerability, it is definitely worth exploring. And if someone isn’t respecting your boundaries—or you’re having trouble respecting their’s—it may time to have an honest conversation. <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>Read your full monthly horoscope here</a>.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=3.3687943262411><h2>Scorpio</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Scorpio.png><p>You’re allowed to unsubscribe from energies that aren’t in alignment with your values, Scorpio. This is especially important to remember as October’s full moon lunar eclipse touch es down on your committed seventh house of significant others. And because Venus (the planet ruling over this lunar event) is highlighting your 11th house of community, this eclipse could lead to major changes in your social life as a whole. Fortunately, the sun, Mercury and Mars are currently transiting your sign, which is giving you the strength to see beyond false hopes and ideals that no longer contribute to your growth. In the meantime, reflect on your social exchanges, specifically those taking time and energy away from your personal commitments. If someone—or something—is siphoning too much of your energy and the process leaves you unfulfilled, it’s time to check in with your reality. <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>Read your full monthly horoscope here</a>.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=2.884375><h2>Sagittarius</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Sagittarius.png><p>Change is always a good thing when life becomes too stagnant. And because the last eclipse on the Taurus-Scorpio series will touch down on your sixth house of work, health, and day-to-day affairs, you could experience a shift in your daily life. This happens at the same time Venus is bringing grounding and healing energy to your 10th house of career, authority, and reputation in the world.

The same goes for that unrealistic pipe dream you’ve been exploring. October’s lunar eclipse will send a bolt of lightning to your fifth house of authenticity, passion projects, and self-expression, bringing some of your manifestations into being. This manifestation could revolve around children or fertility, but also your creativity. You may be putting forth a persona that is not in alignment with your truth, all for the been the sake of your financial security. It’s time to get to know you—the real you.

During this time, you may be realizing that certain aspects of your personal life—especially the parts that have been weighing your down—have reached their expiration date. Chances are, you’ve been contemplating these issues since 2021. Now that Venus in Virgo is also activating your eighth house of intimacy and metamorphosis, you could come to terms with what needs to be tweaked—or fully transformed—when it comes to your energetic and financial exchanges. If you don’t feel secure in your personal space, reflect on the root of this matter. Is there a new system or strategy that needs to be implemented?

Venus is also igniting your committed seventh house of relationships, placing an added emphasis on your one-on-one partnerships. When looking back at the last two years, what have you learned about intimacy, loyalty, and establishing a beneficial union?
