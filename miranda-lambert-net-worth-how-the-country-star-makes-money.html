The “Bluebird” singer bested Brooks & Dunn to become the most decorated ACM Award-winner in history, proving just how tremendous her talent is. Her staggering net worth is well-deserved.</p><p dir=ltr>Miranda, who is nominated for five ACMs at the 2022 ACM Awards on March 7, 2022, is worth an estimated $60 million, according to <a title=https://www.celebritynetworth.com/richest-celebrities/singers/miranda-lambert-net-worth/ href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" data-auth=NotApplicable data-linkindex=1>Celebrity Net Worth</a>. Her nine successful studio albums all offer a fantastic display of her authentic country sound. Her 2001 self-titled album was just the start of a lifetime of success.</p><p dir=ltr>She has sold more than seven million albums, earning her first-ever No. 1 hit on Billboard’s Hot Country Songs chart with “The House That Built Me.” The singer has been very passionate about breaking stereotypes in country music.</p><p dir=ltr><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Richest-Girl-in-Town-Miranda-Lambert-Has-an-Impressive-Net-Worth.jpg></p><p dir=ltr>“To me, country music is about real life, the good and the bad,” she told&nbsp;<a title=https://www.npr.org/2011/10/27/141737468/miranda-lambert-breaking-the-country-music-mold href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" data-auth=NotApplicable data-linkindex=2>NPR</a>&nbsp;in 2011. “That’s why country started, and it was because of&nbsp;Hank Williams&nbsp;telling true stories. And I don’t see why a woman can’t tell the truth just as fast as a man can.”</p><p dir=ltr>Over the years, the Texas native has received several accolades for her accomplishments in the music industry. In addition to her record-shattering 35 ACM wins, she has picked up three Grammy Awards, 14 CMA Awards, six ACM Awards, and more. Due to the coronavirus pandemic, the “Tin Man” artist postponed her Wildcard Tour in 2020. From 2014 to 2019, Miranda was on the road for her Platinum Tour, Roadside Bars & Pink Guitars Tour, Keeper of the Flame Tour, Highway Vagabond Tour and Livin’ Like Hippies Tour.</p><p dir=ltr>In 2003, the Pistol Annies member appeared on Nashville Star, a country music singing competition on USA. Given the level of fame she’s achieved since, it’s hard to believe Miranda finished in third place.</p><p dir=ltr>After establishing herself as a dominant force in the country music industry, Miranda started her own wine line and winery. Red 55 Winery has since blossomed into a family business. She also launched her first official perfume in October 2021.</p><p dir=ltr>“They are more than just a novelty wine,” Miranda shared in&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" data-auth=NotApplicable data-linkindex=0>an interview</a>&nbsp;about her wine brand. “The quality of the wine stands up against others in the same price range. So many people buy them to simply display on a shelf. Drink them … there’s more where that came from.”</p><p dir=ltr>In 2012, she joined her then-husband,&nbsp;<a href=#><b>Blake Shelton</b></a>, on<i>&nbsp;The Voice</i>&nbsp;as a season 2 battle advisor for Team Blake. In 2015, the pair called it quits after four years of marriage. Miranda is now happily married to her husband,&nbsp;<a href=#><b>Brendan McLoughlin</b></a>. While the couple, who tied the knot in 2019, have no children, they are living their best lives on Miranda’s Tennessee ranch with their many pets.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46moKuZnpmubrjAppmeqqRiu6bAjLCmq6yYYrWww4ytn55lk6TCr8DRsmSsrJGneq6typ6qZqWfo7K6ew%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./page.html><span>←</span><span>Online Fashion Magazine | Free Fashion Magazine</span></a>
