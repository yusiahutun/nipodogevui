My wife really enjoys it when I suck on her toes. True story."</p><p>"Hey, we play around," he added. "Why not?"</p><p>Since Laich is a pro ice hockey player, he doesn't ask his wife to suck his toes.</p><p>"No, I would never [have her do that to me]," he admitted. "My toes are in skates and workout shoes. I can shower and soap them up, but I would never."</p><p>However, when it comes to his turn-ons, Laich said it's all about the "environment."</p><p>"I like some dim lighting, candles on, music," he explained. "I like that, but then also something specifically that really gets me in the mood would be when my wife wears lingerie. There's an element of risqué, there's an element of desire and lust and also a little space there. So if she wears lingerie but she's just five or six feet away, or maybe she just walks around the bed a little back or walks back, just creates a little bit of space there, is something that's very erotic for myself."</p><p>Waiting for your permission to load the Instagram Media.</p><p>Hough and Laich, who married in 2017, have been very open about the ups and downs with their relationship -- especially when it comes to sex.</p><p>The <a href=#><strong>"America's Got Talent"</strong></a> judge joined her husband on his podcast earlier this month and spoke about how they took Miss Jaiya's <a href=#><strong>popular quiz</strong></a> to determine their "erotic blueprint."</p><p>"A lot of people don't know even what they want," Hough said. "My curiosity has saved my life and honestly saved our relationship many times because we've been curious about like, 'Hey, something doesn't feel right. Instead of just accepting it for how it is, let's look into something.'"</p><p>"When I took the test, I realized that there were certain things that gave me connection and intimacy that were different than what gave Brooks connection and intimacy," she added. "By almost learning each other's language -- sort of like love languages -- it was almost like a menu of how we could please each other sexually, but also intimately."</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:ebdce5b1-92b8-516d-8927-a9d0deacb7ee data-container-ref=toofab:article:548bbb36-1e40-5c4d-9fca-4365fe5a09af data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/ac/5by4/2019/07/31/ac143fb9798259fe8a71cfce77a631d3_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">NBC</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">'America's Got Talent' 5th Judge: Madness Ensues as Night's Craziest Acts Advance</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>Last week, the <a href=#><strong>"Dancing with the Stars"</strong></a> alum spoke to <a href=#><strong>Women's Health</strong></a> about her journey of self-discovery she went through shortly after marrying the pro athlete. Hough also <a href=#><strong>revealed</strong></a> she's "not straight."</p><p>"I [told him], 'You know I'm not straight, right?' And he was like, 'I'm sorry, what?' I was like, 'I'm not. But I choose to be with you,'" she recalled.</p><p>While initially unsure about baring all to her husband, Hough's "massive transformation" has helped her forge an even deeper bond with him, she explained, "I think there's a safety with my husband now that I'm unpacking all of this, and there's no fear of voicing things that I've been afraid to admit or that I've had shame or guilt about because of what I've been told or how I was raised."</p><p>Laich <a href=#><strong>went to Instagram</strong></a> to praise his wife over her honestly in Women's Health.</p><p>"So proud of my wife @juleshough for the woman she is, and her courage to share her journey of trials and triumphs," he wrote. "You can learn more about it below, and join the movement she is creating surround personal transformation and growth! Love you so much babe!"</p><p><strong>Got a story or a tip for us?
