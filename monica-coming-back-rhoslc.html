The answer is no. <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=# data-type=link data-id=https://people.com/monica-garcia-exits-real-housewives-of-salt-lake-city-8548107>People</a> confirmed on January 23, 2024—the day the third part of the The Real Housewives of Salt Lake City reunion premiered—that Monica would not be returning for RHOSLC Season 5.</p><p>Prior to the confirmation, Monica revealed in an Instagram Live after the first part of The Real Housewives of Salt Lake City Season 4 reunion that she had not been asked back yet for Season 5. “I have not been asked back yet. I have no idea. So I do not know yet,” she said. Monica then asked former cast member Danna Bui-Negrete, who was a Friend on The Real Housewives of Salt Lake City Season 4, if she would come back for Season 5, to which Danna smiled and responded, “I don’t know.”</p><p><a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=# data-type=link data-id=https://www.the-sun.com/entertainment/10009281/rhoslc-monica-garcia-not-offered-contract-season-five/>The Sun</a> also confirmed in January 2024 that Monica had yet to be invited back to The Real Housewives of Salt Lake City. “Monica hasn’t heard from Bravo yet,” the insider said. “She’s been left in the dark and believes they’re waiting to see more of the public’s opinion during the reunion before making a decision.” Another source added, “Casting for next season has not yet been decided.”</p><p>After Monica’s Instagram Live, cast member Lisa Barlow took to Twitter to suggest that she wouldn’t be welcome if she returned. “When you play all of your cards, you’re out,” Lisa tweeted. Lisa also responded to fans who claimed that The Real Housewives of Salt Lake City would need Monica to come back to be “successful.”</p><p>“I love you queen but the show needs to have people you don’t like in order for it to be successful. We want to be entertained and want to see the mess unfold,” a user tweeted, to which Lisa responded, “I’ve been on show where people have hated me for 4 seasons.”</p><p>“If Monica doesn’t come back they as well put y’all on pause!,” another user tweeted, to which Lisa responded, “it’s your opinion.” Cast member Heather Gay also told Variety in 2023 that she doesn’t plan on filming with Monica ever again. “I don’t think I ever will. Ever,” she said. “It’s pretty definitive for myself. I can’t speak for my other cast members, but for me, it’s pretty clear.”</p><p>Lisa Barlow told Deadline that if Monica did come back, <a href=#>their relationship would be difficult to rebuild</a>. “The fact that [Garcia] can send her friends videos inciting her mother, and yelling at her mom, and demeaning her mother, I could never trust her again,” she said. “I just couldn’t trust her. I don’t want her in my home. I don’t want her in my space.”</p><p>However, she acknowledged one point, that Monica makes for “great TV”. She added, “It was hard because, for me, it was dealing with someone that’s very sophomoric. I like to argue smart. Heather [Gay] and I can dish and take. I think with Monica it was a little hard because her jeers were so low. I mean, how do you respond to someone that’s saying, ‘Fix your face, you’re ugly.’ You can’t respond to that.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57y6KqratforyvtcKaZJynnZ67qHnBmpqkZaKdvLS4wmg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./how-to-watch-macys-thanksgiving-day-parade-live.html><span>←</span><span>How to Watch Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade 2023 Live For Free: Stream</span></a>
