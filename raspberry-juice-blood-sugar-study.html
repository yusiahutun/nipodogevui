However, if you’re looking to enjoy the delicious flavor of raspberries when they’re not in-season (how are they so expensive?), raspberry juice is a must. Not only is it delicious, new research highlights that it can also help maintain healthy blood sugar levels!</p><p>A study published in <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Food&nbsp;and&nbsp;Function</a>&nbsp;looked at the positive effect raspberry juice had on blood sugar control in adults with metabolic syndrome or pre-diabetes. Researchers noted that raspberries retain about 22 percent of anthocyanin contents when they’re juiced compared to when they’re fresh. <a href=#>Anthocyanins</a> are chemical compounds that give raspberries their vibrant red color. Previous studies have shown that the anthocyanins in raspberries help prevent insulin resistance in those with type 2 diabetes by removing free radicals from the body.</p><p class=inline-stn-player></p><p>Raspberry juice containing less anthocyanins might sound like a bummer, but researchers found that it provided the same blood sugar stabilizing-effect as the fruit itself. In fact, participants’ blood insulin levels began lowering within the first 30 minutes of drinking it. This led them to conclude that unsweetened raspberry juice can be an effective drink for <a href=#>managing blood sugar levels</a> quickly and warding off diabetes over time.</p><p>Store bought raspberry juice is tricky to find on its own without being mixed with other flavors. Also, those varieties are sometimes full of sugar and preservatives. For a more natural and sugar-free option, you can buy it in powder form online (<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Buy on Amazon, $17.99</a>) and try mixing one tablespoon into an eight ounce glass of water for a refreshing drink. This means you can get the blood sugar controlling perks of raspberries in a delicious and vibrant red sip.</p><p>This article was updated on October 4, 2022.</p><p>First For Women aims to feature only the best products and services.
