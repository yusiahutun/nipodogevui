The Welsh football club is currently thriving under their ownership, and the two men have also embraced Welsh life and culture.</p><p>Ryan, who was born in 1976, began his acting career in 1991 when he appeared in the teen soap opera ‘Hillside.’</p><p>His big break, however, came in 1998 when he landed the lead role in the sitcom ‘Two Guys and a Girl.’ This kickstarted his career in comedy.</p><p>His big Hollywood break was probably ‘National Lampoons Van Wilder’ in 2002.</p><p>In 2004 he appeared alongside Wesley Snipes and WWE wrestler Triple H, in Blade: Trinity, the third installment in the Blade franchise. The movie was a box office failure and was slammed by critics and audiences alike.</p><p>His next attempt at cracking the superhero genre didn’t fare much better when he appeared in the 2010s ‘Green Lantern.’</p><p>Ironically, he first played the character of Deadpool in X-Men Origins: Wolverine.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-62282 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/famouspeopletoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Who-is-Ryan-Reynolds.jpg.webp alt="Who is Ryan Reynolds" width=800 height=1200 sizes="(max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 24px), 720px" data-pin-media=https://famouspeopletoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Who-is-Ryan-Reynolds.jpg id=mv-trellis-img-5 data-trellis-processed=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-62282 class=wp-caption-text>@Getty</p><p>Fans have been desperate to see Deadpool come to life on the big screen, with fans convinced that Ryan would be the perfect man to play the ‘Merc with a Mouth.’ Unfortunately, this version of Deadpool was nothing like the comics, and audiences hated it.</p><p>Luckily for Ryan, he got the chance to right the wrongs made by the producers as he was cast to play Deadpool once again in 2016.</p><p>This version of the character remained true to the comics. He was funny, he was sarcastic, he had a filthy mouth, and he regularly broke the ‘fourth wall.’</p><p>Fans loved it, as well as the sequel in 2018. Ryan will soon be playing Deadpool for the 3rd time (4th if you count the first attempt) where he will appear alongside Hugh Jackman, who will reprise his role as Wolverine. Fans are unbelievably excited to see this, as the two have amazing chemistry together.</p><p><strong>READ MORE:</strong> <a href=#>Juliette Porter Net Worth</a></p><h2><strong>Is Ryan Reynolds related to Burt Reynolds?</strong></h2><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-62287 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/famouspeopletoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Are-Ryan-Reynolds-and-Burt-Reynolds-related.jpg.webp alt="Are Ryan Reynolds and Burt Reynolds related" width=1200 height=1200 sizes="(max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 24px), 720px" data-pin-media=https://famouspeopletoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Are-Ryan-Reynolds-and-Burt-Reynolds-related.jpg id=mv-trellis-img-6 data-trellis-processed=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-62287 class=wp-caption-text>@Getty</p><p>Okay, so we’ve looked at both men’s careers, but now we need to look at whether the two are related.</p><p>Because both men worked in Hollywood as actors, and because they shared the same last name, rumors started circulating which stated that Ryan Reynolds was the son of Burt Reynolds.</p><p>Is Ryan Reynolds related to Burt Reynolds, and if so, is he really his son?</p><p>Well, the answer is no.</p><p>The two men are not and were never related, and they certainly are not/were not father and son.</p><p><strong>READ THIS NEXT:</strong> <a href=#>What is Cindy Fuccillo’s net worth</a>?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiekaK8tr%2FPnqappJWpvKWt2GeaqKVfnsBuvtiapWaqla67sLjDrGSrnZyWwaawjK2mZpqlp8FuvsSypaiklKh8</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./drug-dealer-44-spent-millions-luxury-cars-designer-clothes-lavish-getaways-sentenced-25-years-trafficking-ton-cocaine-html.html><span>←</span><span>Drug dealer, 44, who spent millions on luxury cars, designer clothes and lavish getaways sentenced t</span></a>
