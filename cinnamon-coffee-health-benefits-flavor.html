But no matter how you take it, there are a few very good reasons why you may want to consider adding cinnamon to your next mug of coffee.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>The Health Benefits of Cinnamon</h2><p>Cinnamon is one of the most popular spices in the world, and rightfully so. In addition to providing a warm kick to any drink or dish, it’s <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">full of antioxidants</a> that fight inflammation and battle cell-damaging free radicals, it has <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">anti-neurodegenerative properties</a> that can prevent conditions like dementia, and it may even <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">protect against cancer</a>.</p><p class=inline-stn-player></p><p>And now there’s another reason to love it: According to Dr. Oz, the spice can also <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">fight your risk of Type 2 diabetes</a> because it contains a compound that <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">mimics insulin</a> and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">uses digestive enzymes</a> to break down carbs. Moreover, it’s able to <a href=#>cut the risk of heart disease</a>, which is another major health problem often found alongside diabetes.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>How To Incorporate Cinnamon Into Your Coffee Routine</h2><p>Don’t just sprinkle a little cinnamon on the top of your drink. Instead, go straight to the source: your coffee maker. Coffee Masters NYC champion Erika Vonie appeared on a recent episode of Dr. Oz’s show and suggested sprinkling a large spoonful of cinnamon directly onto your pot’s coffee grounds themselves before brewing. “That way you don’t have the cinnamon sediment at the bottom of your cup in that last swig,” she explained. “This can be [served] hot, this can be [served] cold, whatever you like.”</p><p>Dr. Oz points out a last big bonus of adding cinnamon: It can often just be a perfect swap for sugar, no added sweetness necessary. And if you want to give your morning cup even more of a boost, it may be time to consider <a href=#>including a pinch of salt</a> or <a href=#>throwing in a tablespoon of almond butter</a>. Not only will you have a rich, warm drink for the morning, but it’s also a perfect treat for this cold time of year. Consider giving cinnamon-infused coffee a try!</p><p>This article was updated on Thursday, August 4 at 11:30 am EST.
