But comments she made about her sister, Noah’s, <a href=#>music</a> didn’t sit right with her younger sibling. The feud between the <a href=#>celebrity</a> family has been boiling over for almost two years.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-miley-cyrus-family-all-seek-help-for-fame>Miley Cyrus’ ‘family all seek help for fame’</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2023/10/GettyImages-840020324-1024x683.jpg><p>It appears the Cyrus family feud isn’t going to get better anytime soon with Miley’s latest comments about her sister.</p><p>During the interview, the music icon spoke about growing up with fame, as she was propelled into the spotlight with her <a href=#>TV</a> show, Hannah Montana. She then spoke about how her family dealt with the criticism and adoration.</p><p>She even confessed that all of her family see professionals to discuss their mental <a href=#>health</a>, as the effects of fame take their toll.</p><p>Miley then moved on to discussing her sister Noah, saying certain members of her family like the limelight more than others. She noted how younger Noah loves being a musician and the artistry that comes with that.</p><p>But it was her comments about Noah’s music that appeared to hit a nerve.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-miley-cyrus-describes-sister-noah-s-music-and-it-didn-t-go-down-well>Miley Cyrus’ describes sister Noah’s music – and it didn’t go down well</h2><p>Miley told Joe about Noah’s track: “She’s got a record out that I love called The End of Everything … and it’s the most depressing EP you’ll ever listen to.”</p><p>For listeners, it may appear she was complimenting her little sis, but she then branded her a “20-year-old emo kid”. After discussing it further, Miley and Joe conclude it’s down to Noah growing up on the road as the older star filmed Hannah Montana.</p><p>Miley Cyrus then explained Noah ‘compares’ herself to the Flowers hitmaker. She used her lyrics as an example.</p><p>She said: “She has a song where she says, ‘My sister’s like sunshine / It’ll follow her wherever she goes / But I’m more like a rain cloud.’ You know, it’s like, she’s really got this idea of me.”</p><p>Despite what she said, the 30-year-old confessed she worries about her 20-year-old sibling. Discussing how young people have a tougher time growing up and feeling the need to compare themselves to those around them.</p><p>However, Noah <a href=# rel=nofollow>commented</a> on a <a href=#>TikTok</a> video of the podcast, and didn’t seem to take it well.</p><p>She wrote: “The disrespect in this video…”</p><p>It’s not clear how deep the family drama goes, but at their mom’s wedding this year, Noah and Baison didn’t attend. However, Miley did show up and joined the honeymoon.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-deep-dive-into-the-cryptic-cyrus-feud>Deep dive into the cryptic Cyrus feud</h2><p>Parents Billy Ray Cyrus and Tish break up in 2022, after almost 30 years together. They split more than once during their time together, but this time was for good and divorce papers were filed.</p><p>Only four months after the breakup, Billy Ray gets engaged to girlfriend Firerose. Then in September, Miley unfollows her dad on Instagram and he did the same.</p><p>“Miley is all about peace, but she didn’t agree with some things that her father has done. It has really escalated, and they are not on good terms,” an insider told The Sun.</p><p>In May 2023, Tish is engaged to her partner Dominic Purcell. The Prison Break TV star and Miley’s mom tie the knot in August. Three of the five children she shares with Billy Ray attended the wedding, with Miley the maid of honor. Brandi and <a href=#>Trace</a> were there, but Braison and Noah shared photos of themselves shopping when the ceremony was happening instead.</p><p>A source chimed in: “Miley’s family are completely divided, and it’s a really sad situation. She is being very adult in it, but has found it very frustrating.</p><p>“It seems like madness to not go to your own mother’s wedding, but she was proud to be there to support her. The kids have sided with either their mum or their dad, and there’s not a lot of communication between them. It has been worsening for the past year, and it doesn’t look like there’s an end in sight.”</p><p><strong>MORE</strong>: <a href=#>Miley Cyrus’ called Foo Fighters’ Taylor Hawkins for advice two days before he died</a></p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFsZmpoX2aAcLnIpZyyZZOuv7a%2FjKygrKyVp3qkrculqmaglad6sMHTZp2oql2ZtrS%2BxKynnpukYq6nwMSrZK6mlp65tbHRnptmm5%2Bjs6a%2F0qKmp2c%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./kasimpasa-sk-12-football-club-facts.html><span>←</span><span>Kasmpaa Sk: 12 Football Club Facts</span></a>
