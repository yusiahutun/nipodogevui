Collecting PopSockets is also addictive, and with so many colors and styles, it's easy to amass an extensive collection.</p><p>However, the biggest issue facing PopSocket lovers is wireless charging. How do you wirelessly charge your phone if you have a PopSocket attached? Luckily, your handy PopSocket and wireless charging can cooperate with each other.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>There are several wireless charging options for PopSocket users, including a few solutions from the company itself. Without further ado, here's how you use wireless charging with your PopSocket!</p><h2 id=if-you-already-have-a-wireless-charger-try-it-out-with-your-popsocket>1. If You Already Have a Wireless Charger, Try It Out with Your PopSocket</h2><p>This may seem like an obvious suggestion, but if you already have a wireless charger that you used with your phone before putting a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored">PopSocket</a> on your case, try it out before looking for other options. Sometimes your phone may still be able to charge wirelessly even through your PopSocket, so it's worth trying before you start looking for other options.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>Because some wireless chargers are designed to work through thick phone cases, they can still function properly through a <a href=#>PopSocket</a>. So while you'll likely have to try one of the other three options in this post, it's at least worth trying if you already own a wireless charger, especially if it's a powerful one from a well-known brand.</p><h2 id=use-a-swappable-popsocket>2. Use a Swappable PopSocket</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/examples-of-swappable-popsockets.jpg><p>Due to the demands of a large portion of its customer base, PopSocket launched Swappable PopSockets. As the name implies, this version of the PopSocket lets you affix the base to your phone and easily swap out the top portion.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>The previous version, Classic PopSockets, came with the top and base permanently connected. Unfortunately, this meant that you either had to rip off PopSockets when you wanted to change the design or swap between phone cases with a different PopSocket.</p><p>On top of making it easier for customers to swap between their favorite PopSocket designs, Swappable PopSockets make wireless charging super easy. These PopSockets were specifically designed with customer requests in mind, which is awesome to see from a large company.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>With a Swappable PopSocket, all you have to do to charge your phone wirelessly is pop the top off the base and set your phone down on a wireless charger. Because many wireless chargers are designed to charge through cases that are 5mm thick, the small amount of added space with the PopSocket base isn't enough to interfere with charging.</p><p>Although you can still buy Classic PopSockets at certain retailers, PopSocket is only manufacturing Swappable PopSockets now. So if you're purchasing a PopSocket anywhere other than directly from PopSocket, make sure it's the Swappable version because that's the <a href=#>best PopSocket version</a> on the market.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><h2 id=remove-your-case-while-charging>3. Remove Your Case While Charging</h2><p>Although this is an obvious idea, it's worth covering because it's still a viable option. If you remove your phone case entirely, there's nothing in the way between your phone and the wireless charger. Removing your phone case is a great option if you have a lot of Classic PopSockets in your collection or if your phone case is incredibly easy to take off.</p><p>And although Swappable PopSockets are easy to take off too, you might be prone to losing the decorative top when it's not attached to your phone. It's a lot harder to lose a bulkier phone case.</p><h2 id=use-the-poppower-wireless-charger>4. Use the PopPower Wireless Charger</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/example-of-poppower-charger-made-specifically-for-popsocket-wireless-charging.jpg><p>The PopSocket company has done a lot to answer customer demands and stay relevant despite seeming at first like a trendy, short-lived fad. For example, they designed the <a href=#>PopPower wireless charger</a>, which continues to sell out quickly at multiple retailers.</p><p>The PopPower charger has a circular design, with an indented circle in the middle for your PopSocket to sit. When you're ready to <a href=#>charge your phone wirelessly</a>, all you have to do is line up your PopSocket with the hole in the middle of the charger, and you're good to go. While most PopSockets will work with the PopPower charger, the company lists out <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">incompatible PopSocket designs</a>, like PopGrip Lips, Disco Crystal, or any PopSocket containing metal.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>The PopSocket-designed wireless charger is a popular option, but they're difficult to get your hands upon. Despite launching in early 2020, consumers complained about the lack of supply some 18 months later.</p><p>The PopPower sales page is often nonexistent or temporarily taken down at popular retailers like Amazon, BestBuy, Walmart, or Target. The only place that seems to restock and keep designs up on the site consistently is the PopSocket website.</p><p>A few of the most popular options include the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">black, floral PopPower charger</a> and the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">solid white charger</a>, though you'll have to keep checking back to see if either option is currently in stock. There are frequently other designs available, but you'll need to keep checking the website for when they restock.</p><h2 id=grow-your-popsocket-collection>Grow Your PopSocket Collection</h2><p>Now that you know a few different ways to wirelessly charge your phone with a PopSocket, nothing stops you from growing a massive custom collection. There are so many unique PopSocket designs out there, making it easy to find a couple (or ten!) that fit your style. And not having to sacrifice the convenience of wireless charging to have a cool-looking PopSocket on your phone is fantastic.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>And if you don't have a PopSocket yet, or you've been on the fence about buying one, now's your chance! It may seem strange to think about something being attached to the back of your phone where it usually feels smooth, but you'll quickly get used to the feeling and enjoy the PopSocket being there. The benefits greatly outweigh the disadvantages.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rq3KnqysnZ%2Bbe6S7zGinqKijpLCssdNmrqKqlaGytL%2BMnJ%2Baqpeeu6h7</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./mixing-skincare-ingredients.html><span>←</span><span>What Not to Use with Retinol, According to Experts</span></a>
