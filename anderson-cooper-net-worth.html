He was born in Manhattan, New York, the younger son of author Wyatt Emory Cooper and socialite/artist Gloria Vanderbilt, who was a direct descendent of shipping and railroad magnate Cornelius Vanderbilt and the last to carry his name.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/GettyImages-52694494.jpg><p>When Cornelius, Cooper’s great-great-grandfather, died in 1877, he had a net worth of $100 million—$2.7 trillion adjusting for inflation. It was “an insane amount of money today, but in 1877 it boggled the imagination,” Cooper explained on an episode of The Late Show with Stephen Colbert. “One out of every 20 dollars in circulation belonged to Commodore Vanderbilt… He had more money than the US Treasury.”</p><p>In his book, <a data-pmc-sp-product=25e977bb586c3e0d0ea612bbfdb10f16 href=# custom-ga-data='{"1pd":true,"category":"article-page","details":"Vanderbilt: The Rise and Fall of an American Dynasty","label":"buy-now","event_type_label":"Affiliate","url":true,"product":{"dimension1":"%=href=%","name":"Vanderbilt: The Rise and Fall of an American Dynasty","price":"11.99","id":"B08R3WD7WD","category":"Criticism"},"id":1348768,"location":true}' custom-ga-track=click rel=nofollow>Vanderbilt: The Rise and Fall of an American Dynasty</a> , Cooper examined the history of his family on his mother’s side, chronicling how their massive fortune had dwindled to almost nothing by the time it fell to Cooper’s mother Gloria. Passing away at age 45 due to alcoholism, her father Reginald <a rel=noopener href=#>died in debt</a> and his account held a little over $423,000. Though thanks to a trust fund locked away by her grandfather, Cornelius Vanderbilt II, Gloria inherited $2.5 million (or about $36 million by today’s standards).</p><p>Growing up, Cooper became more aware of how money affected his upbringing, he told CBS Sunday Morning, “I view the money as kind of a pathology that infected subsequent generations, because I think they all grew up with this idea that there would always be money there, and there was no need for them to actually work.”</p><p>He continued after overhearing a conversation from his mother, “She just never had a plan. She just felt like – I once heard, I think I was, like, 14 or 15, I remember I was going upstairs in the house and I heard her on the phone saying to a friend of hers, ‘Well, I’ll always be able to make money.’ And I remember stopping and freezing when I heard that and thinking, ‘We are doomed.'”</p><p>And that for me was a huge factor in, I started working as much as I could. I got a job as a child model, ’cause when you’re 13, 14, there’s not a lot you can actually do,” the anchor said. “Work for me has been the thing which has gotten me through everything. Work has always been the one constant in my life from the time I was, you know, working as a child model as a kid. It was something that was reliable, that helped me calm myself, and, you know, know that I was building a foundation for a life.”</p><p>Cooper said there was “no trust fund” in his mother’s will but upon her death, age 95, <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Page Six</a> revealed Vanderbilt’s will, which was filed in Manhattan surrogate court, actually did leave Cooper with almost all of her estate in the form of property. While the sum wasn’t known at the time, it was later discovered to be less than $1.5 million. Cooper will follow in his mother’s footsteps by not leaving much to his sons Wyatt and Sebastian, except paying for their college education. “I don’t believe in passing on huge amounts of money,” the CNN anchor, 54, told Air Mail’s Ashley Baker and Michael Hainey on their <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Morning Meeting</a> podcast before the birth of his second child. “I’m not that interested in money, but I don’t intend to have some sort of pot of gold for my son. I’ll go with what my parents said … ‘College will be paid for, and then you gotta get on it.’”</p><p>Cooper shares sons Wyatt, born in April 2020 and Sebastian, born February 2022, with ex-partner Benjamin Maisani, who were both born via surrogate. While the couple is no longer together (they split in 2018), they remain the best of friends and co-parent their two boys successfully. “It’s awesome. It’s probably an unusual setup, but I knew he would be a great dad, and he is. We’re exes, but we’re family to each other, and we love each other as family and as co-parents,” Cooper told <a rel="noopener nofollow" href=#>People</a>. “There’s the usual bickering that any two people have when there’s a kid involved, like what time should he go to swimming class, or should he wear the overalls, or whatever,” he admits, adding, “But all silly, minor things. We get along great.”</p><p>He also said, “I’ve always believed that if you’ve been with somebody and that ends, in terms of an intimate relationship, if you love somebody, there’s no reason why that love shouldn’t continue.”</p><p>In 2023, Cooper revealed that he’s planning to use the same tactic as his parents for their inheritance. “My dad made clear to me there wasn’t a Vanderbilt fortune waiting for me,” he told&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>People</a>.&nbsp;“In retrospect, I’m really glad he did that because from the get-go, it just made it clear that whatever my mom’s past was, it had nothing to do with me from a financial standpoint. That set me out very early on a course of wanting to work and find out what I was passionate about. I want my kids to figure out what drives them, and I want to help them figure that out.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/GettyImages-521276890.jpg><p>Cooper has a beach house in the coastal Brazilian town of Trancoso and famously renovated an old, 19th-century firehouse in New York’s Greenwich Village, which he paid $4.3 million for in January 2010. The property boasts four floors and over 8,240 square feet. In 2015, the property served as the set for an H&M advertisement starring David Beckham and Kevin Hart.</p><p>In 2021, Cooper listed the apartment left to him by his late mother for sale at 30 Beekman Place on the east side of Midtown Manhattan—a classic five on the second floor—for $1.12 million with monthly maintenance setting the owner back $4,311. It was priced modestly, noted the <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">New York Times</a> at the time, saying: “The apartment is on a low floor, has a high maintenance and is in a neighborhood that is slightly off the beaten track. Also, unrenovated since 1997, when Ms. Vanderbilt moved in, it needs a total rehab.” It sold in a mere few months after hitting the market.</p><p>“When I was growing up, we moved every four years,” Cooper told the Times, reflecting on his time spent in the apartment. “My mom was always remodeling and redecorating, never quite satisfied with the story the room was telling at the time. Moving would be part of that. She would get restless with a place. For her to stay in this apartment for 23 years, which for my mom is an eternity, it had to change. I think she got tired of all the moving, and she decided to burrow into this place and just work on it.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=what-is-anderson-cooper-s-cnn-salary>What is Anderson Cooper’s CNN salary?</h2><p>As the host of CNN’s Anderson Cooper 360, Cooper earns a chiefly annual salary of $12 million. Cooper embarked on his journalism career after graduating from Yale with a Bachelor of Arts degree, studying political science and international relations.</p><p>He became a correspondent for ABC news in 1995 and was promoted to co-anchor of World News Now in September 1999. He joined CNN in 2001 anchoring alongside Paula Zahn on American Morning and a year later became the weekend prime-time anchor for the network. Cooper was given his own show, Anderson Cooper 360, on September 8, 2003. In 2007, he signed a multi-year deal with CNN that would also allow him to continue to occasionally contribute as a correspondent for 60 Minutes on CBS. He doubled his annual salary from $2 to $4 million.</p><p>As mentioned, Cooper has won numerous awards for his coverage of significant world events. In 1997, his reporting on Princess Diana’s funeral won him an Emmy; in 2005 he received a Peabody for covering Hurricane Katrina; and won two Emmys in 2011 for his coverage of the Haiti earthquake.</p><p>During the 2016 presidential election, Cooper’s profile was bolstered significantly. He was in the running to become Kelly Ripa’s co-host on ABC’s Live permanently—he was Ripa’s top choice to replace Michael Strahan. But Cooper said staying at CNN was a top priority, per the Hollywood Reporter. He signed a new long-term deal to remain at the news network, although would continue to fill in on the program as well as contribute several pieces for CBS’s 60 Minutes each season.</p><p>Cooper has hosted <a href=# rel=noopener>CNN’s New Year’s Eve</a> Live since 2002 and has appeared alongside Andy Cohen since 2017. They’ve become somewhat of an institution for their on-screen antics. “Anderson and I will be the people partying on CNN [though] we will be partying responsibly,” Cohen told <a href=# rel=noopener>Rolling Stone</a>. “My job is to take Anderson out of his comfort zone [and] my job is to be a party ringleader for everyone watching us on New Year’s Eve. And that is what I will continue to do. And as a matter of fact, if the correspondents are not drinking this year, I will be partying even harder on their behalf.”</p><p>He continued: “One of the very cool things about doing New Year’s Eve with Anderson is that I don’t have to plan anything, New Year’s Eve is a holiday that stresses people out; it rarely delivers. For me now, this is going to be my sixth year, and it has delivered every year. I absolutely love it.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/vanderbilt.jpg><p><span class=s1><i>Our mission at STYLECASTER is to bring style to the people, and we only feature products we think you’ll love as much as we do.
