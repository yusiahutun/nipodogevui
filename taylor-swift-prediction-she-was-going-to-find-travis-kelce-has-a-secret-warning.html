From her breakup with British movie star Joe Alwyn to her epic love story with NFL heartthrob <a href=#>Travis Kelce</a>, the singer’s personal life has made headlines throughout the year. As per astrology, Taylor and Travis’ <a href=#>instant connection was predicted years ago</a> and their love story would be mostly smooth sailing apart from one major lookout for the Grammy-winning <a href=#>celebrity</a> that comes in the latter half of this year.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2023/11/GettyImages-1738320717-1-1024x782.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-taylor-swift-s-strong-love-story-with-travis-kelce-comes-with-a-secret-warning>Taylor Swift’s ‘strong’ love story with Travis Kelce comes with a secret warning</h2><p>Travis and Taylor are having a flourishing year, not just romantically but also in their individual careers. The <a href=#>celebrity couple</a>‘s Libra-Sagittarius connection is going strong as they complement each other perfectly. Plus, their sun-moon connection hints that they could understand what the other person needs in a relationship to feel cherished and safe.</p><p>For Taylor, who is a Sagittarius, the second half of the year is significant as astrology predicts it is the time to explore ‘undiscovered avenues of pleasure.’ With <a href=#>Travis traveling to Argentina</a> to see Taylor perform and the <a href=#>music</a> legend honoring his presence by changing her Karma lyrics in November, Swifties can say in a heartbeat that Tay Tay is truly thriving in a once-in-a-lifetime kind of <a href=#>love</a> but their blissful time comes with a warning.</p><p>As per Sagittarius’ horoscope prediction of the year, November could be a crucial month for those who are partnered up as jealousy from others may affect their lives. Someone new might also show interest but there is no harm in enjoying harmless flirting for the couple. After the critical phase, December will be all about love as Venus enters the sign swiftly on Friday, December 29.</p><p>Taylor has reportedly already made <a href=#>holiday plans with Travis</a> to start new rituals for the star duo and Traylor fans are eager to get a sneak peek of their holiday snaps!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2023/11/GettyImages-1787708639.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-travis-experiencing-real-magic-in-love-life>Travis experiencing ‘real magic’ in love life</h2><p>The 34-year-old has been on a quest to find his The 1 for a while. From entering a <a href=#>TV</a> show to meet 50 women to <a href=#>making a bracelet for Tay Tay</a>, Travis Kelce knows how to put his heart out there and it seems like, the universe is listening.</p><p>As per Libra’s prediction of the year, the real magic in their love lives will happen towards the end of the year, and Travis’ smitten look for the <a href=#>Miss Americana and Heartbreak Prince crooner</a> says it is working.</p><p>Travis is candid talking about dating someone with an aura that he has never experienced before and he is <a href=#>serious about it</a>. The 34-year-old NFL icon gushes over the <a href=#>relationship</a> in a new interview <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">saying</a>, “Obviously I’ve never dated anyone with that kind of aura about them…. I’ve never dealt with it.”</p><p>“But at the same time, I’m not running away from any of it…. The scrutiny she gets, how much she has a magnifying glass on her, every single day, paparazzi outside her house, outside every restaurant she goes to, after every flight she gets off, and she’s just living, enjoying life. When she acts like that I better not be the one acting all strange.”</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFsZmppX2eBcMDAsqOoql2oxKqy02anq52UnrC1tc6nZKyglWLEor%2BMoKaippdiwbB5xaKlnWWkp663tdJmop6kk5p6qa3SZphmq5WYv6bAjLCYq6aZo7Rw</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./yris-palmer-star-lash-dating-ex-husband-html.html><span>←</span><span>Who is Yris Palmer &amp;amp; Who Are Her Boyfriend &amp;amp; Ex-husband?</span></a>
